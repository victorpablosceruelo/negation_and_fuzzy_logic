% The files for tlp.cls are distributed in a concatenated form (using the
% LaTeX 2e 'filecontents' environment). The file 'tlpcls.ltx' is one of these
% files. The 'filecontents' environment allows the files to be unpacked 
% easily with the correct filenames.
%
% To unpack the source files, copy the tlpcls.ltx file to a temporary
% directory. Then pass the tlpcls.ltx file though LaTeX 2e as if it were a
% document (i.e. TeX it with LaTeX 2e).  LaTeX will then unpack the files.
%
% tlpcls.ltx contains the following files:
%
%   tlp.cls        the class file
%
%   acmtrans.bst   bibliography style file
%
%   tlp2egui.tex   authors' guide
%   tlp2egui.bib   bibliography database file used in authors' guide
%   tlp2egui.bbl   bibliography generated from above database
%
%   tlp2esam.tex   sample pages
%   tlp2esam.bib   bibliography database file used in sample pages
%   tlp2esam.bbl   bibliography generated from above database
%   aopmath.sty    style file used in the sample pages
%
% If LaTeX 2e refuses to unpack the files, you probably already have
% them installed (in the TeXinput path). In this case, if the supplied files
% are newer, we strongly recommend that you use the newer files. To do this
% rename any existing file and unpack the distribution again.
%
% The bibliography style file, acmtrans.bst, may be downloaded from
% http://www.acm.org/tocl/latex/
%
% Once you have unpacked the files, move the tlp.cls file to a directory
% in the TeXinput path. Then typeset TLP2EGUI.TEX and TLP2ESAM.TEX for
% instructions and sample pages.

Ciao Prolog for DEBIAN (alpha packaging)
-------------------------------------

This is a Prolog environment originally created by the Laboratorio
CLIP, Dpto. Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad Politecnica de
Madrid, Spain.

Ciao Prolog contains a full-featured development environment (hosted
within Emacs).  This package allows you to build and debug code, read
documentation, and experiment with Prolog code.

The homepage is at: http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es

Have Fun with Prolog! :-)

NOTES:

1. The Emacs mode should work out-of-the-box on a Debian system
   with proper paths, etc. for the tools to work.

2. These are experimental packages. Use at your own risk.

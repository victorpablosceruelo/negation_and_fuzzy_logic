Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------

HttpAsyncClient is a library for asynchronous client-side HTTP communication built on HttpCore NIO
and HttpClient components.

HttpAsyncClient is NOT meant to replace or supersede Apache HttpClient. It is a complementary
library to Apache HttpClient intended for special cases where ability to handle a great number of
concurrent connections is more important than performance in terms of a raw data throughput or
for those users who prefer event-driven APIs.

The HttpAsyncClient 4.0 API is still very experimental and is expected to change in the course
of the ALPHA development phase.

Please note that currently HttpAsyncClient DOES NOT support

* HTTP state management (cookies)
* HTTP authentication
* Stateful HTTP connections

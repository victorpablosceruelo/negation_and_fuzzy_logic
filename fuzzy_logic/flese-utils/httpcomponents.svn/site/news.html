<div class="section">
<h3>19 January 2014 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3.2 (GA) released<a name="a19_January_2014_-_HttpComponents_HttpClient_4.3.2_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>HttpClient 4.3.2 (GA) is a maintenance release that delivers a number of improvements as well as bug fixes for issues reported since 4.3.1 release. SNI support for Oracle JRE 1.7+ is being among the most notable improvements. </p>
<p>Users of HttpClient 4.3 are encouraged to upgrade.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>27 December 2013 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.3.1 (GA) released<a name="a27_December_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpCore_4.3.1_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>This maintenance release fixes a number of bugs and regressions found since 4.3, mostly in the NIO transport components. All users of HttpCore 4.3 are advised to upgrade.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>31 October 2013 - HttpComponents HttpAsyncClient 4.0 (GA) released<a name="a31_October_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpAsyncClient_4.0_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is the first stable (GA) release of Apache HttpAsyncClient 4.0. HttpAsyncClient is a library for asynchronous client-side HTTP communication built on top of HttpCore NIO transport. It is a complementary library to Apache HttpClient intended and optimized for special cases whereby ability to scale to many thousands of concurrent connections is more important than performance in terms of raw data throughput. </p>
<p>HttpAsyncClient 4.0 is designed to have similar APIs as Apache HttpClient 4.3 and a comparable feature set. In addition HttpAsyncClient provides full support for zero-copy file upload and download operations. It presently does not support transparent content decompression and automatic I/O error recovery. These features may be added in future releases.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>7 October 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3.1 (GA) released<a name="a7_October_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpClient_4.3.1_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is a maintenance release that addresses a number of issues reported since release 4.3, including one major security issue. Users of HttpClient 4.3 are strongly advised to upgrade.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>12 September 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3 (GA) released<a name="a12_September_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpClient_4.3_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.3. The 4.3 branch enhances HttpClient in several key areas and includes several notable features and improvements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Java 7 try-with-resources for resource management (connection release.)</li>
<li>Added fluent Builder classes for HttpEntity, HttpRequest, HttpClient and SSLContext instances. </li>
<li>Deprecation of preference and configuration API based on HttpParams interface in favor of constructor injection and plain configuration objects.</li>
<li>Reliance on object immutability instead of access synchronization for thread safety. Several old classes whose instances can be shared by multiple request exchanges have been replaced by immutable equivalents. </li>
<li>DefaultHttpClient, DecompressingHttpClient, CachingHttpClient and similar classes are deprecated in favor of builder classes that produce immutable HttpClient instances. </li>
<li>HttpClient builders now dynamically construct a request execution pipeline tailored specifically to the user configuration by physically excluding unnecessary protocol components.</li>
<li>There is now an option to construct a minimal HttpClient implementation that can only execute basic HTTP message exchanges without redirects, authentication, state management or proxy support. This feature might be of particular use in web crawler development. </li>
<li>There is now option to avoid strict URI syntax for request URIs by executing HTTP requests with an explicitly specified target host. HttpClient will no longer attempt to parse the request URI if it does not need to extract the target host from it.
<p>This release also includes all fixes from the stable 4.2.x release branch.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>12 September 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.2.6 (GA) released<a name="a12_September_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpClient_4.2.6_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is a maintenance release that addresses a number of non-critical issues reported since release 4.2.5.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>5 August 2013 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.3 released<a name="a5_August_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpCore_4.3_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpCore 4.3. The most notable features in the 4.3 branch are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecation of preference and configuration API based on HttpParams interface in favor of constructor injection and plain configuration objects.</li>
<li>Reliance on object immutability instead of access synchronization for thread safety. Several old classes whose instances can be shared by multiple request exchanges have been replaced by immutable equivalents.</li></ul>
<p>The 4.3 branch also contains performance optimizations such as reduced TCP packet fragmentation and more efficient lease / release operations for pools of persistent connections on the client side.</p>
<p>This release also includes all fixes from the 4.2.x release branch.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>5 August 2013 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.2.5 released<a name="a5_August_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpCore_4.2.5_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is a maintenance release that fixes a number of bugs found in NIO components since 4.2.4. Users of earlier versions of HttpCore 4.2 are advised to upgrade.</p>
<p>This is likely to be the last release in the 4.2.x branch.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>12 June 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3-beta2 released<a name="a12_June_2013_-_HttpComponents_HttpClient_4.3-beta2_released"></a></h3>

<div class="section">
<h3>16 May - HttpComponents HttpAsyncClient 4.0-beta4 released<a name="a16_May_-_HttpComponents_HttpAsyncClient_4.0-beta4_released"></a></h3>
<p>The 4.0 BETA4 release delivers significant performance improvements in request execution, especially for short HTTP messages, and also re-aligns programming interfaces used by the library with HttpCore 4.3 and HttpClient 4.3 APIs. Configuration and preference APIs of HttpAsyncClient are now consistent with those used by HttpClient 4.3.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>8 May - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.3-beta2 released<a name="a8_May_-_HttpComponents_HttpCore_4.3-beta2_released"></a></h3>

<h3>22 May 2012 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.2 (GA) released<a name="a22_May_2012_-_HttpComponents_HttpClient_4.2_GA_released"></a></h3>
<p>This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.2. The most notable enhancements included in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>New facade API for HttpClient based on the concept of a fluent interface. The fluent API exposes only the most fundamental functions of HttpClient and is intended for relatively simple use cases that do not require the full flexibility of HttpClient. However, the fluent API almost fully relieves the users from having to deal with connection management and resource deallocation.</li>
<li>Redesigned and rewritten connection management code. </li>
<li>Enhanced HTTP authentication API that enables HttpClient to handle more complex authentication scenarios. HttpClient 4.2 is now capable of making use of multiple authentication challenges and retry authentication with a fall-back scheme in case the primary one fails. This can be important for compatibility with Microsoft products that are often configured to use SPNEGO/Kerberos as the preferred authentication scheme. </li></ul></div>

<p>New protocol handling API used in conjunction with connection pooling components is expected to make development of asynchronous HTTP client agents and HTTP proxies easier and less error prone.</p>
<p>Connection pool components are based on mature code migrated from HttpClient and HttpAsyncClient modules but have a slightly different API that makes a better use of Java standard concurrent primitives. </p></div>

<p>The focus of the development efforts will be gradually shifting towards providing better test coverage, documentation and performance optimizations. </p></div>

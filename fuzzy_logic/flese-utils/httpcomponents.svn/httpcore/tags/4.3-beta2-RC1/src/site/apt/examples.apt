HttpCore Examples

    * {{{./httpcore/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpGet.java} Basic HTTP GET}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to execute a series of synchronous (blocking) HTTP GET requests.

    * {{{./httpcore/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpPost.java} Basic HTTP POST}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to execute a series of synchronous (blocking) HTTP POST requests 
    that enclose entity content of various types: a string, a byte array, an arbitrary input stream.  

    * {{{./httpcore/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpServer.java} Basic HTTP server}}
    
    This is an example of an HTTP/1.1 file server based on a synchronous (blocking) I/O model.

    * {{{./httpcore-nio/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpClient.java} Asynchronous HTTP GET}}
    
    This example demonstrates how HttpCore NIO can be used to execute multiple HTTP requests 
    asynchronously using only one I/O thread.

    * {{{./httpcore-nio/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpServer.java} Asynchronous HTTP 
    server}}
    
    This example demonstrates the use of HttpCore NIO to build an asynchronous (non-blocking) 
    HTTP server capable of direct channel (zero copy) data transfer.

    * {{{./httpcore-nio/examples/org/apache/http/examples/nio/NHttpReverseProxy.java} Asynchronous 
    HTTP reverse proxy}}
    
    This example demonstrates how HttpCore NIO can be used to build an asynchronous, fully
    streaming reverse HTTP proxy.

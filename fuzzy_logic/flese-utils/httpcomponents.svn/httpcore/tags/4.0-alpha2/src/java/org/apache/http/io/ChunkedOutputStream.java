/**
 * <p>This class implements chunked transfer coding as described in the 
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.6">Section 3.6.1</a> 
 * of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>. 
 * Writes are buffered to an internal buffer (2048 default size). Chunks are guaranteed 
 * to be at least as large as the buffer size (except for the last chunk).</p>
 * 
 * <h>3.6.1 Chunked Transfer Coding</h>
 * <p>
 * The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to transfer it as a series 
 * of chunks, each with its own size indicator, followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing 
 * entity-header fields. This allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along 
 * with the information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has received the full 
 * message.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  Chunked-Body   = *chunk
 *                   last-chunk
 *                   trailer
 *                   CRLF
 *
 *  chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
 *                   chunk-data CRLF
 *  chunk-size     = 1*HEX
 *  last-chunk     = 1*("0") [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
 *
 *  chunk-extension= *( ";" chunk-ext-name [ "=" chunk-ext-val ] )
 *  chunk-ext-name = token
 *  chunk-ext-val  = token | quoted-string
 *  chunk-data     = chunk-size(OCTET)
 *  trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of the chunk. The 
 * chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is zero, followed by the trailer, 
 * which is terminated by an empty line.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The trailer allows the sender to include additional HTTP header fields at the end 
 * of the message. The Trailer header field can be used to indicate which header fields 
 * are included in a trailer (see section 14.40).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response MUST NOT use the trailer for any 
 * header fields unless at least one of the following is true:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * a)the request included a TE header field that indicates "trailers" is acceptable in 
 * the transfer-coding of the response, as described in section 14.39; or,
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * b)the server is the origin server for the response, the trailer fields consist entirely 
 * of optional metadata, and the recipient could use the message (in a manner acceptable 
 * to the origin server) without receiving this metadata. In other words, the origin server 
 * is willing to accept the possibility that the trailer fields might be silently discarded 
 * along the path to the client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This requirement prevents an interoperability failure when the message is being received 
 * by an HTTP/1.1 (or later) proxy and forwarded to an HTTP/1.0 recipient. It avoids a 
 * situation where compliance with the protocol would have necessitated a possibly infinite 
 * buffer on the proxy. 
 * </p>

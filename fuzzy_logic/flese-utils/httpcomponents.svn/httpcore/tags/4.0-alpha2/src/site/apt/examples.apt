HttpCore Examples

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpGet.java}Simple HTTP GET}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to execute a series of simple HTTP GET requests.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpPost.java}Simple HTTP POST}}
    
    This example demonstrates how to execute a series of simple HTTP POST requests that enclose entity 
    content of various types: a string, a byte array, an arbitrary input stream.  

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/ElementalHttpServer.java}Simple HTTP server}}
    
    This is an example of a simple, but fully functional HTTP/1.1 server written with only a few dozens 
    lines of Java code.

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/src/contrib/org/apache/http/contrib/spring/SpringHttpDemo.java}Spring integration example}}
    
    HttpCore components can be conveniently wired together using any IoC container, such as {{{http://www.springframework.org/}Spring}}. The bean descriptor for HttpCore
    components can be found {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/src/contrib/org/apache/http/contrib/spring/http-beans.xml}here}}

    * {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/httpcomponents/httpcore/trunk/src/contrib/org/apache/http/contrib/compress/}Content compression}}

    These request / response interceptors implement client- and server-side content compression / 
    decompression logic. They can be simply added to any existing HTTP processor to make it content 
    compression enabled. If you use a IoC container to initialize HTTP processors, you will not even 
    have to recompile your application.

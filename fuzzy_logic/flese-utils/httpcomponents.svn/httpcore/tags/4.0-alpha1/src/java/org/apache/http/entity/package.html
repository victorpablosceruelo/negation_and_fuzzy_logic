Representations for HTTP message entities.

An {@link org.apache.http.HttpEntity entity} is the optional content of a
{@link org.apache.http.HttpMessage message}.
You'll find a basic selection of entity implementations here.
If you need to send an entity, you can provide it for example as a
{@link org.apache.http.entity.ByteArrayEntity byte array},
{@link org.apache.http.entity.StringEntity string},
{@link org.apache.http.entity.FileEntity file}, or through an arbitrary
{@link org.apache.http.entity.InputStreamEntity input stream}.
If you receive a message with an entity, you typically get that as a
{@link org.apache.http.entity.BasicHttpEntity basic} entity.
Entity implementations can be
{@link org.apache.http.entity.HttpEntityWrapper wrapped},
for example to
{@link org.apache.http.entity.BufferedHttpEntity buffer}
the content in memory.

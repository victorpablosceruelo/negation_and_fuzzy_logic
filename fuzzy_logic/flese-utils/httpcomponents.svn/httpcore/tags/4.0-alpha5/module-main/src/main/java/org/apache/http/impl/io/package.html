Default implementations for interfaces in
{@link org.apache.http.io org.apache.http.io}.

<br/>

The data {@link org.apache.http.io.HttpDataTransmitter transmitter}
and {@link org.apache.http.io.HttpDataReceiver receiver} interfaces
provide an abstraction from
<code>java.io</code> and <code>java.nio</code>.
These interfaces are adapted to the plain
{@link org.apache.http.impl.io.HttpDataOutputStream output} and
{@link org.apache.http.impl.io.HttpDataInputStream input} streams.

<br/>

There are implementations of the transport encodings used by HTTP,
in particular the chunked encoding for
{@link org.apache.http.impl.io.ChunkedOutputStream sending} and
{@link org.apache.http.impl.io.ChunkedInputStream receiving} entities.

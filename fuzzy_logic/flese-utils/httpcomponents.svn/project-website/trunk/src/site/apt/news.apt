*  19 January 2014 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3.2 (GA) released

    HttpClient 4.3.2 (GA) is a maintenance release that delivers a number of improvements 
    as well as bug fixes for issues reported since 4.3.1 release. SNI support for 
    Oracle JRE 1.7+ is being among the most notable improvements. 
    
    Users of HttpClient 4.3 are encouraged to upgrade.

*  27 December 2013 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.3.1 (GA) released

    This maintenance release fixes a number of bugs and regressions found since 4.3, mostly in the 
    NIO transport components. All users of HttpCore 4.3 are advised to upgrade.

*  31 October 2013 - HttpComponents HttpAsyncClient 4.0 (GA) released

    This is the first stable (GA) release of Apache HttpAsyncClient 4.0. HttpAsyncClient is 
    a library for asynchronous client-side HTTP communication built on top of HttpCore NIO 
    transport. It is a complementary library to Apache HttpClient intended and optimized for 
    special cases whereby ability to scale to many thousands of concurrent connections is more 
    important than performance in terms of raw data throughput. 

    HttpAsyncClient 4.0 is designed to have similar APIs as Apache HttpClient 4.3 and a comparable
    feature set. In addition HttpAsyncClient provides full support for zero-copy file upload and 
    download operations. It presently does not support transparent content decompression and 
    automatic I/O error recovery. These features may be added in future releases.

*  7 October 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3.1 (GA) released

    This is a maintenance release that addresses a number of issues reported since release 4.3,
    including one major security issue. Users of HttpClient 4.3 are strongly advised to upgrade.

*  12 September 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.3 (GA) released

    This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.3. The 4.3 branch enhances HttpClient 
    in several key areas and includes several notable features and improvements: 

    * Support for Java 7 try-with-resources for resource management (connection release.)

    * Added fluent Builder classes for HttpEntity, HttpRequest, HttpClient and SSLContext instances. 

    * Deprecation of preference and configuration API based on HttpParams interface in favor of
    constructor injection and plain configuration objects.

    * Reliance on object immutability instead of access synchronization for thread safety. 
    Several old classes whose instances can be shared by multiple request exchanges have
    been replaced by immutable equivalents. 

    * DefaultHttpClient,  DecompressingHttpClient, CachingHttpClient and similar classes are 
    deprecated in favor of builder classes that produce immutable HttpClient instances. 

    * HttpClient builders now dynamically construct a request execution pipeline tailored 
    specifically to the user configuration by physically excluding unnecessary protocol components.

    * There is now an option to construct a minimal HttpClient implementation that can only execute 
    basic HTTP message exchanges without redirects, authentication, state management or proxy 
    support. This feature might be of particular use in web crawler development. 

    * There is now option to avoid strict URI syntax for request URIs by executing HTTP requests 
    with an explicitly specified target host. HttpClient will no longer attempt to parse the request 
    URI if it does not need to extract the target host from it.

    This release also includes all fixes from the stable 4.2.x release branch.

*  12 September 2013 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.2.6 (GA) released

    This is a maintenance release that addresses a number of non-critical issues reported 
    since release 4.2.5.

*  5 August 2013 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.3 released

   This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpCore 4.3. The most notable features in the 4.3
   branch are:

   * Deprecation of preference and configuration API based on HttpParams interface in favor of
     constructor injection and plain configuration objects.

   * Reliance on object immutability instead of access synchronization for thread safety.
     Several old classes whose instances can be shared by multiple request exchanges have
     been replaced by immutable equivalents.
 
   []

   The 4.3 branch also contains performance optimizations such as reduced TCP packet 
   fragmentation and more efficient lease / release operations for pools of persistent 
   connections on the client side.

   This release also includes all fixes from the 4.2.x release branch.

*  5 August 2013 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.2.5 released

    This is a maintenance release that fixes a number of bugs found in NIO components since 4.2.4.

* 22 May 2012 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.2 (GA) released

    This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.2. The most notable enhancements included 
    in this release are:

    * New facade API for HttpClient based on the concept of a fluent interface. The fluent API 
    exposes only the most fundamental functions of HttpClient and is intended for relatively simple 
    use cases that do not require the full flexibility of HttpClient. However, the fluent API 
    almost fully relieves the users from having to deal with connection management and resource 
    deallocation.

    * Redesigned and rewritten connection management code. 

    * Enhanced HTTP authentication API that enables HttpClient to handle more complex 
    authentication scenarios. HttpClient 4.2 is now capable of making use of multiple 
    authentication challenges and retry authentication with a fall-back scheme in case the primary 
    one fails. This can be important for compatibility with Microsoft products that are often 
    configured to use SPNEGO/Kerberos as the preferred authentication scheme. 

* 5 May 2012 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.2 (GA) released

    This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpCore 4.2. The most notable features included in 
    this release are connection pool components for blocking and non-blocking HTTP connections and 
    new asynchronous client and server side protocol handlers.

    New protocol handling API used in conjunction with connection pooling components is expected to 
    make development of asynchronous HTTP client agents and HTTP proxies easier and less error 
    prone.

    Connection pool components are based on mature code migrated from HttpClient and HttpAsyncClient 
    modules but have a slightly different API that makes a better use of Java standard concurrent 
    primitives. 

* 22 February 2012 - HttpComponents HttpAsyncClient 4.0-beta1 released

    This the first BETA release of HttpAsyncClient. This release completes the application 
    programming interface and the feature set of HttpAsyncClient and upgrades to the latest 
    versions of core and client components (HttpCore 4.2-beta1 and HttpClient 4.2-beta1). 
    As of this release HttpAsyncClient is expected to be API stable.

* 10 February 2012 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.2-beta1 released

    This is the first BETA release of HttpClient 4.2. This release completes development of several
    notable enhancements in HttpClient: new facade API, redesigned connection management code 
    and new HTTP authentication API.

* 7 February 2012 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.1.3 (GA) released

    HttpClient 4.1.3 is a bug fix release that addresses a number of non-critical issues found 
    since 4.1.2 primarily in the HTTP caching module.

    This is the first BETA release of HttpCore 4.2. This release ships with an improved 
    asynchronous protocol handling API and new non-blocking client and server HTTP protocol handler 
    implementations. New API is expected to be more flexible especially for writing HTTP proxy or 
    gateway type of services. Upstream projects are encouraged to evaluate the new API and 
    give feedback.

* 23 December 2011 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.1.4 (GA) released

    HttpCore 4.1.4 is a patch release that fixes a number of bugs found since 4.1.3. It is also 
    likely to be the last release in the 4.1.x branch.

* 3 November 2011 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.2-alpha1 released

    This is the first ALPHA release of HttpClient 4.2. The 4.2 branch enhances HttpClient in several
    key areas and includes several notable features and improvements: new facade API, redesigned 
    connection management code and new HTTP authentication API.

* 29 September 2011 - HttpComponents HttpAsyncClient 4.0-alpha3 released

    This is the third ALPHA release of HttpAsyncClient 4.0. This release largely completes 
    the application programming interface and feature set of HttpAsyncClient. While the API may 
    still change in the course of the ALPHA development phase, this is expected to be the last 
    round of major API changes and the API is expected to be reasonably stable as of this release.

* 23 September 2011 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.2-alpha2 released

    This is the second ALPHA release of HttpCore 4.2. This release comes with completely redesigned 
    and rewritten asynchronous protocol handlers. New protocol handling API used in conjunction

    development of asynchronous HTTP client agents and HTTP proxies easier and less error prone.

* 19 August 2011 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.2-alpha1 released

    This is the first ALPHA release of the 4.2 development branch. The most notable feature 
    included in this release is support for connection pools of blocking and non-blocking HTTP 
    connections. Connection pool components are based on mature code migrated from HttpClient and 
    HttpAsyncClient modules but have a slightly different API that makes a better use of Java 
    standard concurrent primitives. Support for connection pools in HttpCore is expected to make 
    development of client and proxy HTTP services easier and less error prone.

    Welcome on board, Sam!

* 26 February 2008 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.0-alpha3 released 

    The third ALPHA release brings another round of API refinements and improvements 
    in functionality. As of this release HttpClient requires Java 5 compatible 
    runtime environment and takes full advantage of generics and new concurrency
    primitives.     

    This release also introduces new default cookie policy that selects a cookie 
    specification depending on the format of cookies sent by the target host. 
    It is no longer necessary to know beforehand what kind of HTTP cookie support 
    the target host provides. HttpClient is now able to pick up either a lenient 
    or a strict cookie policy depending on the compliance level of the target host.

    Another notable improvement is a completely reworked support for multipart 
    entities based on Apache mime4j library.

* 24 January 2008 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0-beta1 released 

    The first BETA version of HttpComponents Core has been released. This release 
    can be considered a major milestone, as it marks the end of API instability 
    in HttpCore. As of this release the API compatibility between minor releases
    in 4.x codeline will be maintained.

    This release includes several major improvements such as enhanced HTTP message 
    parsing API and optimized parser implementations, Java 5.0 compatibility
    for HttpCore NIO extensions.

    The focus of the development efforts will be gradually shifting towards
    providing better test coverage, documentation and performance optimizations. 

* 15 November 2007 - HttpComponents becomes TLP

    The ASF board had approved HttpComponents 'graduation' from Jakarta to a TLP of its own.

    We are now Apache HttpComponents Project!

* 7 November 2007 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.0-alpha2 released 

    The second ALPHA release is another important milestone in the redesign of HttpClient. The 
    release includes a number of improvements since ALPHA1, among which are improved connection 
    pooling, support for proxy chains, redesigned HTTP state and authentication credentials 
    management API, improved RFC 2965 cookie specification.  

* 9 October 2007 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0-alpha6 released 

    The sixth ALPHA version of HttpComponents Core has been released. This release sports an 
    improved message parsing and formatting API in the base module and lots of incremental 
    improvements and bug fixes in the NIO and NIOSSL modules. Based on the improved API, it is now 
    possible to send and receive SIP messages with HttpComponents Core.

* 20 July 2007 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.0-alpha1 released 

    This release represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete rewrite of the old 
    HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several design flaws that existed since 
    the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without a major code overhaul and breaking API 
    compatibility. 

    Notable changes and enhancements: 

    * Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known major architectural shortcomings of 
    the 3.x codeline  

    * Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API   

    * Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more efficient HTTP transport based 
    on HttpCore. HttpClient 4.0 is expected to be 10% to 25% faster than HttpClient 3.x codeline

    * More modular structure   

    * Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers   

    * Support for protocol incerceptors

    * Improved connection management 

    * Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of proxies 

    * Improved handling redirects of entity enclosing requests

    * More flexible SSL context customization 

    * Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of generating HTTP requests and parsing HTTP 
    responses  

* 4 July 2007 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0-alpha5 released 

   The fifth ALPHA version of HttpComponents Core has been released. This release delivers a number 
   of incremental improvements across the board in all modules and adds several performance oriented 
   features such as ability to transfer data directly between a file and a socket NIO channels. 

* 30 March 2007 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0-alpha4 released 

    The fourth ALPHA version fixes a number of bugs and adds a number of improvements to HttpCore 
    base and the HttpCore NIO extensions. This release also introduces NIOSSL extensions that can be 
    used to extend HttpCore non-blocking transport components with the ability to transparently encrypt 
    data in transit using SSL/TLS.

* 6 December 2006 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0-alpha3 released 

    The third ALPHA version of HttpCore has been released. The ALPHA3 release includes a number of API
    optimizations and improvements and introduces a set of NIO extensions to the HttpCore API. 
    NIO extensions can be used to build HTTP services intended to handle thousands of simultaneous 
    connections with a small number of I/O threads.

* 9 June 2006 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0-alpha2 released 

    The second ALPHA version of HttpCore  has been released, which addresses a number of non-critical 
    problems found in the previous release. The upstream projects are strongly encouraged use this 
    release as a dependency while HttpCore undergoes another round of reviews and optimization in the 
    SVN trunk.

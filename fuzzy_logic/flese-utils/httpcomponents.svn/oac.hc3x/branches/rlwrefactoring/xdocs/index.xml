      <section name="The HTTP Client Component">
         <p>
            The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most
            significant protocol used on the Internet today.
            Web services, network-enabled appliances and the growth
            of network computing continue to expand the role of the HTTP
            protocol beyond user-driven web browsers, and increase the
            number of applications that may require HTTP support.
         </p>
         <p>
            Although the
            <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/java/net/package-summary.html">java.net</a></tt>
            package provides basic support for accessing resources via HTTP,
            it doesn't provide the full flexibility or functionality needed
            by many applications.
            The Jakarta Commons HTTP Client component seeks to fill this void
            by providing an efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich package
            implementing the client side of the most recent HTTP standards
            and recommendations.
         </p>
         <p>
            Designed for extension while providing robust support for the
            base HTTP protocol, the HTTP Client component may be of interest
            to anyone building HTTP-aware client applications such as web
            browsers, web service clients, or systems that leverage or extend
            the HTTP protocol for distributed communication.

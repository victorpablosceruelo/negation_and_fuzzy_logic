       <section name="25 January 2003 - HttpClient 2.0 Alpha 2 released">
          <p>After many months and a great resurgence of developers, the new build
              of <em>HttpClient</em> is finally here.  The new group of developers has done
             extensive refactoring to move the project along the new vision.
             The code base has reached a significant level of maturity and we
             expect that the beta builds will come quickly and that the 
             final release of 2.0 is not far away!</p>
            
          <p>The <em>HttpClient</em> revision 2.0 Alpha 2 is available for 
              <a href="downloads.html">download</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Also check out the new <em>HttpClient</em> logo on the maven generated
              <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">website</a>!

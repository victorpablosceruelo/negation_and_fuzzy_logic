/**
 * Represents a Status-Line as returned from a HTTP server.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a> states
 * the following regarding the Status-Line:
 * <pre>
 * 6.1 Status-Line
 *
 *  The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting
 *  of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its
 *  associated textual phrase, with each element separated by SP
 *  characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.
 *
 *      Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and is inherently thread safe.

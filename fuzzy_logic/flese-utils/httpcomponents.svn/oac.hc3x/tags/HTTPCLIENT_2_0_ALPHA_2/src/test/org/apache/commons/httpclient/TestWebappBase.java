/**
 * This suite of tests depends upon the httpclienttest webapp,
 * which is available in the httpclient/src/test-webapp
 * directory in the CVS tree.
 * <p>
 * The webapp should be deployed in the context "httpclienttest"
 * on a servlet engine running on port 8080 on the localhost
 * (name localhost).
 * <p>
 * You can change the assumed port by setting the
 * "httpclient.test.localPort" property.
 * You can change the assumed host by setting the
 * "httpclient.test.localHost" property. A DNS name is preferred over
 * an IP address here.
 * You can change the assumed context by setting the
 * "httpclient.test.webappContext" property.

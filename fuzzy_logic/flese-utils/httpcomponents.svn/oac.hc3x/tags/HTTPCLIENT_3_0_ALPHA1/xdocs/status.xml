    <section name="Current Status">
        <p>We are actively working on the next major release of HttpClient, version 3.0. 
        A number of major changes have already been incorporated into the 3.0 code base, though
        there is still room for more in the final release.  We would like to encourage 
        comment on the API changes and additions made so far.</p>

        <p>HttpClient 2.0 is no longer being actively developed, with the exception of 
        bug fixes.  A 2.0.1 release is planned for the near future.</p>

	<p>It is important to note that HttpClient CVS HEAD is no longer fully compatible 
	 with 2.0 APIs. We encourage using the <tt>HTTPCLIENT_2_0_BRANCH</tt> for production
         development until the 3.0 APIs are stabilized.</p>

To add a new Junit TestCase to one of the "standard" Suites,
you should add it to one (and only one) of the following files:

 * TestNoHost.java
    - use this file if the test has no external dependencies
      (i.e., it runs entirely within the JUnit VM)

 * TestExternalHost.java
    - use this file if the test depends upon a connection to
      the public Internet

 * TestLocalHost.java
    - use this file if the test depends upon a local webserver
      (running on ${httpclient.test.localHost}/
      ${httpclient.test.localPort})

 * TestWebapp.java
    - use this file if the test depends upon the test webapp

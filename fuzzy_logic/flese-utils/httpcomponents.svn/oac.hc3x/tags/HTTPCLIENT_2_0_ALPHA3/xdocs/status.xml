    <section name="Current Status">
        <p>For all current contributors and anyone wishing to contribute to or use 
            <em>HttpClient</em>, we are now in the Beta 1 development stage.</p>

      <p>There is currently a rather complete list of bugs in 
        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">bugzilla</a> now.  To find 
        them, do a query for the *Commons* project, *HttpClient* component, and 
        target milestone *2.0 Beta 1*.</p>

      <p>There are some 
        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16416">strightforward</a> tasks, some 
        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10807">complex</a> tasks, and some 
        <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16429">long and tedious</a> tasks
        somthing for everyone.  All of the bugs that are marked for milestone Beta 1 will have to be
        closed before a Beta 1 drop can be released.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in working on any task, please reassign the bug to yourself and add the 
        list address to the cc field (commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta-apache.org).  When you have a 
        patch, it can be attached directly to the bug.  Any discussion can take place on the mailing list.</p>

      <p>While the Alpha 2 release was finished only recently, it was 14 months from the previous Alpha 1 release.
        While there were many reasons for the previous delay, none of those obstacles are in our way for the
        Beta 1 drop, which we would like to see within the month of February.</p>

    <section name="Action Items">
      <p>Like to help?  There are a number of action items to work on.
        We make extensive use of <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/"> Bugzilla</a>
        where <em>HttpClient</em> can be found as a *component* of the <b>Commons</b> *program*.
        We also mark <tt>//TODO</tt> and <tt>//FIXME</tt> comments in the source files, so they can be 
        easily found by grep or by the <a href="checkstyle-report.html">Checkstyle report</a></p>

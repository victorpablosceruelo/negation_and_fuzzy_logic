      <h3>A simple logging abstraction wrapping log4j and other logging frameworks.</h3>
      <p>
         The <code>org.apache.commons.httpclient.log</code> package
         provides a simple abstraction of
         <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a> and
         similiar logging frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using this abstraction allows <em>HTTP Client</em> to
         seamlessly support <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a>
         and other frameworks without introducing a run-time dependency
         on them.
      </p>
      <p>
         <font color="red">Note:</font> This package is likely to be
         revised or replaced in the near future in order to use the
         similiar abstraction being considered within Log4J itself.
      </p>
      <p>
         Absent any specific configuration settings, this logging
         abstraction will provide the following behaviour:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            If Log4J is in your classpath (specifically, if
            the <code>org.apache.log4j.Category</code> class is in
            your classpath), then the
            {@link org.apache.commons.httpclient.log.Log4JCategoryLog Log4JCategoryLog}
            {@link org.apache.commons.httpclient.log.Log Log} implementation will
            be used for logging.  In this case you may use and configure the
            <em>HTTP Client</em> logging in precisely the same way as any other
            Log4J client.  The <code>log4j.properties.sample</code> file in the
            distribution provides an example of one such configuration.
         </li>
         <li>
            Otherwise, the
            {@link org.apache.commons.httpclient.log.NoOpLog NoOpLog}
            {@link org.apache.commons.httpclient.log.Log Log} implementation will
            be used for logging.
            In this case, no log output will be generated by <em>HTTP Client</em>.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         One may (but need not) provide a Java system property named
         <code>httpclient.log</code> that contains the full-specified name
         of a class implementing {@link org.apache.commons.httpclient.log.Log Log}
         in order to use an alternative logging framework.
         {@link org.apache.commons.httpclient.log.SimpleLog SimpleLog} is
         one such example, providing a subset of Log4J-like functionality, but
         only to the standard output stream.  See the
         <code>simplelog.properties.sample</code> file in the distribution for
         details on configuring the <code>SimpleLog</code>.

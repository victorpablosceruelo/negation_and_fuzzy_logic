================================================================
Building HTTP Client
================================================================

To compile httpclient, you'll want the excellent Ant utility
(version 1.2 or later). It can obtained from:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

You'll also need:

 * an implementation of the Java Secure Socket Extension,
   a standard Java extension available from:
     http://java.sun.com/products/jsse

 * the log4j logging component, available from:
     http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j

To help the build and test targets find these classes,
you must make a copy of the build.properties.sample file,
rename to build.properties, and modify it to reflect the
location of jsse.jar, jnet.jar, jcert.jar and log4j.jar
on your computer.

Once you have Ant, JSSE and log4j properly installed, and
your build.properties file properly configured, you are ready
to build the component:

To build a jar:

$ ant dist

To build the API documentation:

$ ant javadoc

To build the jar and API doc at once:

$ ant dist

Run ant -projecthelp to see a list of all available targets.

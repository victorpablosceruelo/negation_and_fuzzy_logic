 * This abstract class serves as a foundation for all HTTP methods 
 * that support 'Expect: 100-continue' handshake.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (refer to section 10.1.1 
 * of the RFC 2616 for more details) is to allow a client that is 
 * sending a request message with a request body to determine if the 
 * origin server is willing to accept the request (based on the request 
 * headers) before the client sends the request body. In some cases,
 * it might either be inappropriate or highly inefficient for the 
 * client to send the body if the server will reject the message 
 * without looking at the body.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 'Expect: 100-continue' handshake should be used with caution,
 * as it may cause problems with HTTP servers and proxies that
 * do not support HTTP/1.1 protocol.
 * </p>

        <p>HttpClient development team to pleased to announce that <em>HttpClient 2.0 BETA</em>
        development phase has been concluded. The number of bugs discovered in the course of the
        BETA development has been surprisingly low. We are growing confident that <em>HttpClient 
        2.0</em> has reached the required level of maturity, and we hope to have a final 2.0
        release by the end of the Summer or the mid Autumn the latest.</p>

	<p>Only critical or major bug fixes and javadocs enhancements will be made to the 2.0 
        code base in the next few weeks.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the HttpClient development team has been busy working on the next version
        of <em>HttpClient</em>. The next version of <em>HttpClient</em> is going to build upon the 
        foundation laid with <em>HttpClient 2.0</em> while addressing those  architectural 
        shortcomings and flaws identified in the course of 2.0 development. Several well known 
        and much complained about problems cannot be resolved while maintaining complete 2.0 API 
        compatibility. The primary objective of the next version is to fix those design limitations, 
        breaking 2.0 API compatibility where absolutely unavoidable, while preserving overall 
        compatibility with 2.0 use patterns.</p>

	<p>Depending upon how drastic those API changes are going to be, the next version of 
         HttpClient will be designated as <tt>2.1</tt>, <tt>2.5</tt> or <tt>3.0</tt>.
         The decision is to be taken before 2.0 final release.</p>

	<p>It is important to note that HttpClient CVS HEAD may (and already is) no longer be 
         compatible with 2.0 APIs. We strongly encourage to use <tt>HTTPCLIENT_2_0_BRANCH</tt>
         until next version API are stabilized.</p>

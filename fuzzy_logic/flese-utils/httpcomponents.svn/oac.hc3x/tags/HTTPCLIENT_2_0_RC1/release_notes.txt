Release 2.0 Beta 1
-------------------
Changes since Release 2.0 Alpha 3:

 * Changed HttpConnection to use socket timeout instead of busy 
   waiting while expecting input.

 * Added a getResponseContentLength() method to HttpMethod.

 * Changed HttpClient to accept correctly encoded URLs instead of 
   attempting to encode them within HttpClient.

 * 'Expect: 100-continue' logic factored out into an abstract 
   ExpectContinueMethod class

 * 'Expect: 100-Continue' handshake disabled per default, as it may not work 
   properly with older HTTP/1.0 servers or proxies.

 * Reengineered authentication code.  This includes a fix for 
   HttpClient continually attempting to authenticate to digest realms and 
   provides for better future extensibility.

 * Authenticator class deprecated

 * Improved user documentation and example code.

 * Added ability to differentiate between different hosts using the 
   same realm names.

 * Added support for specifying a virtual host name to use.

 * Fixed problem with half-closed connections causing a 
   HttpRecoverableException to be thrown when HttpClient attempts to read 
   from a socket.

 * Improved reliability with the HEAD method and servers that 
   incorrectly include a response body.

 * Improved support for connection keep-alive when communicating via a proxy

 * Added an override of HttpClient.executeMethod that lets the
   caller specify an HttpState object.

 * HttpConnectionManager is now a property of the HttpClient class, 
   not of the HttpState class

 * Added ability to specify the local address that HttpClient should 
   create connections from.


Release 2.0 Alpha 3
-------------------
Changes since Release 2.0 Alpha 2:

 * Abstract EntityEnclosingMethod class has been introduced to encapsulate
   common behaviour of all entity enclosing methods

 * "Expect: 100-continue" handshake support added for POST, PUT & multipart POST

 * Added support for chunked requests for POST and PUT.

 * Added support for 303 See Other redirections.

 * Changed input and output streams to use buffering to improve performance.

 * Improved handling of multivalue headers. Order is now preserved and 
   convenience methods have been added to access each value.

 * In non-strict mode each cookie sent with the request is put on a separate 
   request header. In strict mode all cookies are crammed into one request header, 
   as before.

 * ResponseInputStream class deprecated.

 * RequestOutputStream class deprecated.

 * Custom character set can be specified for all multipart classes. 

 * Custom content type can be specified for FilePart derived multipart classes.

 * The useDisk methods in GetMethod class deprecated.


Release 2.0 Alpha 2

Changes since Release 2.0 Alpha 1:

 * Mavenized builds.
 
 * Digest authentication.  NTLM authentication.
 
 * Multipart post.
 
 * Added a StatusLine class to manage the status line of a
   http response.

 * Added ability to cusomize SocketFactory for http and https. 
   New Protocol class to allow for more protocols than just http/s.

 * Removed previously deprecated Cookie.createCookieHeader(String,
   String,boolean,Cookie[]) method (port number is required for
   future compatibility).

 * Also removed Cookie.createCookieHeader(String,String,Cookie[])
   method, which should have been deprecated (port number is
   required for future compatibility)

 * Renamed HttpMethod.followRedirects to getFollowRedirects,
   for consistency (and made the corresponding change to
   HttpMethodBase)

================================================================
Building HttpClient
================================================================

To compile httpclient, you'll want the excellent Ant utility
(version 1.2 or later). It can obtained from:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/
 
Your Ant installation is ready when you can run Ant from the httpclient
project directory:

 $ ant

To build the project you'll also need:

 * an implementation of the Java Secure Socket Extension,
   a standard Java extension available from:
     http://java.sun.com/products/jsse

 * the Jakarta-Commons logging component, available from:
     http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/

To help the build and test targets find these classes,
you must make a copy of the build.properties.sample file,
rename to build.properties, and modify it to reflect the
location of jsse.jar, jnet.jar, jcert.jar and commons-logging.jar
on your computer.

Once you have Ant, JSSE and Commons-Logging properly installed, and
your build.properties file properly configured, you are ready
to build the component:

To build a jar:

 $ ant dist

To build the API documentation:

 $ ant javadoc

To build the jar and API doc at once:

 $ ant dist

Run ant -projecthelp to see a list of all available targets.

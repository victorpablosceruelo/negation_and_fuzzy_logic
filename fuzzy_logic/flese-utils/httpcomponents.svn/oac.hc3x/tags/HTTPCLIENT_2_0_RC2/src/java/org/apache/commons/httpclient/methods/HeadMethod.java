/**
 * Implements the HTTP HEAD method.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP HEAD method is defined in section 9.4 of 
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>:
 * <blockquote>
 * The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT
 * return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained
 * in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical
 * to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can
 * be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the
 * request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is
 * often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility,
 * and recent modification.

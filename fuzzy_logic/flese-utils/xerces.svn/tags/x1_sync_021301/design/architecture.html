  <h2>Parsing</h2>
  <p>
   The parser is designed as a pipeline. Information flows from the 
   scanner to the validator to the parser. In the pipeline architecture, 
   one component acts as a source of events while the other components 
   in the pipeline are filters. The other components both listen to and 
   propagate the information. The following diagram illustrates the 
   layout of the pipeline in the parser.
  </p>
  <p>
   <table border='2' cellpadding='10' cellspacing='0'>
    <tr class='diagram'>
     <td>
      <table cellpadding='7' cellspacing='0'>
       <tr class='diagram'>
        <td class='diagram'>XML<br>Document</td>
        <td><img alt='--&gt;' src='images/arrow-right.gif'></td>
        <td class='component'>Scanner</td>
        <td><img alt='--&gt;' src='images/arrow-right.gif'></td>
        <td class='component'>Validator</td>
        <td><img alt='--&gt;' src='images/arrow-right.gif'></td>
        <td class='component'>Parser</td>
        <td><img alt='--&gt;' src='images/arrow-right.gif'></td>
        <td class='diagram'>Application<br>API</td>
       </tr>
      </table>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </p>
  <p>
   The scanner implements 
   <code><a href='design.html#XMLDocumentSource'>XMLDocumentSource</a></code>
   and parses an XML document to perform callbacks to the
   next stage in the pipeline. The validator implements both
   <code><a href='design.html#XMLDocumentHandler'>XMLDocumentHandler</a></code> 
   to receive the callbacks from
   the scanner and <code>XMLDocumentSource</code> to
   act as the source for the next stage in the pipeline.
   <sup><a href='#note.1'>[1]</a></sup> 
   Finally,
   the parser implements <code>XMLDocumentHandler</code>
   to receive the callbacks from the validator and then expose
   that information to the application API.
  </p>
  <p>
   By abstracting the components into <em>sources</em> and
   <em>handlers</em>, the stages in the pipeline can be connected
   together like puzzle pieces. Stages can be removed, added, or
   replaced with other implementations. For example, in a parser 
   configuration with no validation, the scanner component can
   be connected directly as the source for the parser, thereby 
   bypassing the validator and shortening the code path. 
  </p>
  <p>
   This architecture can also be used to implement upcoming 
   standards like <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude'>XInclude</a>.
   A new XInclude filter can be written that includes document
   fragments into the pipeline stream before or after the validator.
   <sup><a href='#note.2'>[2]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
   Parsing of DTDs can also be viewed as a pipeline. Since the
   DTD is referenced in the document instance by XML syntax
   (the DOCTYPE declaration), the DTD pipeline is triggered by 
   the document scanner. This contrasts with XML Schema because
   there is no XML syntax that associates a Schema grammar with
   a document; a special attribute in the document instance is
   used as a <em>hint</em> to the location of the grammar. The 
   following diagram illustrates the layout of the DTD pipeline.
  </p>

   <table border='2' cellpadding='10' cellspacing='0'>
    <tr class='diagram'>

        <td><img alt='--&gt;' src='images/arrow-right.gif'></td>
        <td class='diagram'>Application<br>API</td>
       </tr>
       <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
       <tr class='diagram'>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td><img alt='--&gt;' src='images/arrow-right.gif'></td>
        <td class='component'>DTD<br>Grammar</td>
       </tr>
      </table>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that the DTD scanner communicates directly with the validator.
   The validator receives the callbacks from the DTD scanner in order
   to create and populate the DTD grammar object. In this way, the
   validator acts as a "tee", propogating the DTD events to both
   the next stage in the pipeline and the DTD grammar object. This
   allows the validation stage in the pipeline to be completely 
   removed from the parser configuration, if needed.
  </p>
  <a name='Configuration'></a>
  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <p>
   The parser object used by the application is comprised of a series
   of connecting components. The parser puts the components together,
   transmits settings to each component, and controls their actions.
   The configuration is managed by the parser object and the values are 
   communicated to the components. The following diagram shows a
   general parser configuration and its components. (No ordering or
   direct connection between components should be implied.)
  </p>
  <p>
   <table border='2' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='7'>
    <tr class='diagram'>
     <td>
      <table border='0' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5'>
       <tr align='center' valign='middle'>
        <th class='manager' colspan='9'>Parser</td>
       </tr>
       <tr align='center' valign='middle'>
        <td class='non-config-component'>Symbol<br>Table</td>
        <td class='config-component'>Error<br>Reporter</td>
        <td class='config-component'>Entity<br>Manager</td>

        <td class='non-config-component'>Datatype<br>Validator<br>Factory</td>
       </tr>
      </table>

    </tr>
   </table>
  </p>
  <p>
   In the parser configuration, the parser object acts both as the 
   configuration manager and as a component in the pipeline.
   The parser object does <strong>not</strong> have to be the final
   stage in the pipeline, though. Most users of the parser will not
   need to create new parsers by assembling the components but may
   want to change some part of the behavior of the parser (e.g. 
   capitalize element names that get created in the DOM tree). By 
   having the parser be the last stage, the user can extend the
   parser class and override the necessary methods.
  </p>
  <a name='Configuration.FeaturesAndProperties'></a>
  <h3>Features &amp; Properties</h3>
  <p>
   Features and properties are provided via the extensible mechanism
   found in SAX2. Features are boolean settings on the parser while
   properties are object settings. There are a number of SAX2 features 
   as well as additional parser features defined by the Xerces parser. 
   The following list includes only those features which are of 
   general use to most components and should not not be considered a 
   complete list.
   <span class='netscape'>
   <dl>
    <dt><tt>http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces</tt></dt>
    <dd>Sets whether the parser should process namespaces.</dd>
    <dt><tt>http://xml.org/sax/features/validation</tt></dt>
    <dd>Sets whether the parser should validate instance documents.</dd>
    <dt><tt>http://apache.org/xml/features/validation/dynamic</tt></dt>
    <dd>
     This setting tells the parser to validate instance documents if
     the document contains a reference to a grammar. If no reference to
     a grammar is included, then validation is turned off. Setting the
     <tt>http://xml.org/sax/features/validation</tt> feature to
     <code>false</code> overrides this setting.
    </dd>
   </dl>
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   The SAX2 property mechanism is used to communicate information about
   other components in the parser and its internals. The following
   list includes properties defined for general use by most
   parser instances but does not mean that every parser configuration
   will have all of these components. All of the following properties 
   are <strong>read-only</strong>.
   <span class='netscape'>
   <dl>

    </dd>
   </dl>
   </span>
  </p>
  <a name='Configuration.SettingsManagement'></a>
  <h3>Settings Management</h3>
  <p>
   The parser implements the 
   <code><a href='design.html#XMLComponentManager'>XMLComponentManager</a></code> 
   interface and each component implements the 
   <code><a href='design.html#XMLComponent'>XMLComponent</a></code> 
   interface. For this configuration system to work, the parser
   must adhere to the following guidelines:
   <span class='netscape'>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Before each parse, the parser <strong>must</strong> call the 
     <code>reset</code> method on each configurable component.
     This call allows each component to query the state of only
     those features and properties that are important to the operation
     of the component.
    </li>
    <li>
     Any time that the application sets a feature or property on the 
     parser <em>during a parse</em>, the parser <strong>must</strong> 
     pass those settings to each configurable component. This is 
     important because configuration settings can change while parsing 
     an XML document and those settings may directly affect the 
     operation of components. But this does <em>not</em> need to be
     done before or after a parse because each component will query
     settings during the call to <code>reset</code>.
    </li>
   </ul>
   </span>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

   <table border='0'>
    <tr>
     <td><a name='note.1'></a>[1]</td>
     <td>
      For the purposes of discussion, any component that implements
      both the document handler and document source interfaces will
      be known as a "filter".
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td><a name='note.2'></a>[2]</td>
     <td>
      XInclude is defined to work on the 
      <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset'>XML Infoset</a> which
      means that it <em>should</em> occur after validation but there
      may be situations where the application wants to validate the
      included material. In this case, the filter would be inserted
      before the validator so that the document inclusion would 
      be expanded without the validator ever knowing that there was an 
      inclusion. However, since the pipeline does not buffer the
      document, there is a problem with supporting features of 
      specifications that operate on the Infoset.
      <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude#IDwgAq1'>Section 3.1</a>
      of the XInclude specification highlights this problem in the
      example. Any use of 
      <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr'>XPointer</a>
      to reference parts of the document containing the XInclude could
      not be supported without buffering the document in some way.
      Perhaps this means that the best way to support XInclude, and
      other specifications that rely on the XML Infoset, is to 
      operate on the document model (such as DOM) and not to try to
      do it in the parser pipeline.

\subsection{Predicate tree}
\label{sec:PredicateTree}
Firstly, the question of ``how to build a tree for a predicate in \textit{RFuzzy} Program" is the main focus. For convenience, the corresponding tree for the predicate is called as a \textit{predicate tree}. The first step is transforming an \textit{RFuzzy} Program, to obtain the subset of program which is used to create the predicate tree in section \ref{sec:TransformRFuzzy}. The approach of constructing predicate trees from subset of program is presented in section \ref{sec:Construct}. In {SBM} method, to be able to compare two predicate trees, the structure of the concerning trees should be the same. Moreover they ought to preserve the embedded meanings. To ensure this, the concept ``equivalent trees" is introduced in section \ref{sec:EquivalentTree}. According to ``equivalent trees", the predicate tree could be constructed with \textit{identities}, which is claimed to maintain the semantic meaning but reform the structure. This is described in section \ref{sec:ReConstruct}.

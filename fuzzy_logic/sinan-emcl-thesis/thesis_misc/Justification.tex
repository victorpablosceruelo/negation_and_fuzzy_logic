\chapter{The Need For a New  Proposal to Evaluate Similarity Between Fuzzy
Predicates Defined In a Fuzzy Program}
\label{chap:Justification}

In chapter \ref{chap:Introduction} we have mentioned about some existing works in the field of similarity concept in Fuzzy Logic, and also the \textit{SBM} method \cite{Lu} has been highlighted as an intriguing work in the field. In this chapter the \textit{SBM} method is observed in detail, and the layout of the section is as follows: 

In Structured Based Measurement,  a tree is built for each predicate, so comparing two predicates is indeed comparing two trees. In the light of that, section \ref{sec:PredicateTree} introduces the approach for building a tree for predicate. In section \ref{sec:Algorithm}, the algorithm to obtain similarity between two trees is described in detail. Then the shortcomings of the approach are displayed with their corresponding examples in section \ref{sec:Shortcomings}.

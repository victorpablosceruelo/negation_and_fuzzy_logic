The section presents the needed background knowledge is introduced for clarifying the foundations of fuzzy logic. Lattice theory \cite{DP03} is the key to bridge the corresponding relation between fuzzy set/relation and fuzzy logic, and it is illustrated in section 2.1.1. Fuzzy set/relation and fuzzy logic are represented in sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, respectively.

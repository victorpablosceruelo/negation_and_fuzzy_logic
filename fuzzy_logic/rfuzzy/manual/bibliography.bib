We present the RFuzzy framework, a Prolog-based tool for representing and reasoning with fuzzy information.The advantages of our framework in comparison to previous tools along this line of research are its easy, user-friendly syntax, and its expressivity through the availability of default values and types.
In this approach we describe the formal syntax, the operational semantics and the declarative semantics of RFuzzy (based on a lattice). A least model semantics, a least fixpoint semantics and an operational semantics are introduced and their equivalence is proven.We provide a real implementation that is free and available.Besides implementation details, we also discuss some actual applications using RFuzzy."

  title =        {Rfuzzy framework},
  abstract =     {Fuzzy reasoning is a very productive research field that
                  during the last years has provided a number of theoretical
                  approaches and practical implementation
                  prototypes. Nevertheless, the classical implementations,
                  like Fril, are not adapted to the latest formal approaches,
                  like multi-adjoint logic semantics.  Some promising
                  implementations, like Fuzzy Prolog, are so general that the
                  regular user/programmer does not feel comfortable because
                  either representation of fuzzy concepts is complex or the
                  results difficult to interpret.  In this paper we present a
                  modern framework, Rfuzzy, that is modelling multi-adjoint
                  logic. It provides some extensions as default values (to
                  represent missing information, even partial default values)
                  and typed variables. Rfuzzy represents the truth value of
                  predicates through facts, rules and functions.  Rfuzzy
                  answers queries with direct results (instead of constraints)
                  and it is easy to use for any person that wants to represent
                  a problem using fuzzy reasoning in a simple way (by using
                  the classical representation with real numbers).},

\subsection{Predicate tree}
\label{sec:PredicateTree}
In this section, we will answer the question ``how to build a tree for a predicate in RFuzzy Program". For convenience, we call the corresponding tree for the predicate as \textit{predicate tree}. We start by transforming a RFuzzy Program, to obtain the subset of program which we use to create predicate tree in section \ref{sec:TransformRFuzzy}. The approach of constructing predicate trees from subset of program is presented in section \ref{sec:Construct}. In order to compare two predicate trees, the structure of them should be the same, and also preserve the embedded meanings. For this, the concept ``equivalent trees" is introduced in section \ref{sec:EquivalentTree}. According to ``equivalent trees", the predicate tree could be constructed with \textit{identities}, which maintain the semantic meaning but reform the structure. It is described in section \ref{sec:ReConstruct}.

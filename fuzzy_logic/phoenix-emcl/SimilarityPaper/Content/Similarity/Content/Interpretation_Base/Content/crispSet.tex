\subsection{Similarity Between Two Crisp Sets}
\label{sec:crispSim}
Using the definitions of \textit{similarity} in \textit{taxonomy} and \textit{psychology} described in section \ref{sec:RWSim}, the measurements of similarity are categorized into two approaches. One is based on set theory, including \eqref{Jaccard index} Jaccard Index, \eqref{simple matching coefficient} Simple matching coefficient, \eqref{generalized similarity} generalized similarity.
The other is based on proximate distance, \eqref{Hamming distance} Hamming distance, \eqref{p-norm distance} p-norm distance.

In this section we define similarity between crisp sets departing from these two definitions, and develop the relationship between these two methods.

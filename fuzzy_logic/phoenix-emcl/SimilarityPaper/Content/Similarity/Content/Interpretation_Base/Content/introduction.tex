In order to retrieve the similarity between predicates in \textit{Fuzzy Logic}, first we present the intuition of the 
\textit{Interpretation Based measurement} in section \ref{sec:intuition}, followed by  some related work over similarity and dissimilarity described in section \ref{sec:RWSim}. Since the analysis of crisp sets has often provided the basis for a generalization to the measurement of fuzzy sets, we discuss similarity between crisp sets in section \ref{sec:crispSim}, and then extend it into fuzzy sets in section \ref{sec:fuzzySim}.  Subsequently, %according to the corresponding relation between \textit{Fuzzy Logic} and  \textit{fuzzy set/relation} in Chapter \ref{chap:CorrespondingRelation},
similarity between predicates is presented in section \ref{sec:predicateSim}.

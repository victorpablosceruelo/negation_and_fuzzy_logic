/*  bid.pl -- compute opening bid for bridge hand

    This program uses rules set forth in Jacoby (1988) counting
    high-card points, distribution points, and a few heuristics
    like support in 10s and 9s and long suits.

    Method -- find points for each suit independently, sum them,
    then adjust for combinations.  Within a suit, compute high-
    card points, then distribution, then adjust for special
    combinations.

    Feb 1991 -- so far the program only counts points; we need
    a bridge expert to add rules for make_bid/4.

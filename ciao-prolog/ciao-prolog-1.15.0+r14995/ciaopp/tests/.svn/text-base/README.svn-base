- test_all.pl  main program which calls all other testing subprograms.

- settings_test.pl  contains settings for the test collections.

- generate_benchmarks.pl  generates the file benchmarks.pl

- benchmarks.pl is not in CVS since it is automatically generated

- Several subdirectories with the testing subprograms.

  Each one of them should contain (at least) a program called
  test_XXX.pl which exports the predicate main.

  This predicate should call test_options:get_test_options(TEST,Opts).
  This call gives on backtracking all test collections that have to be
  processed for test TEST.

  The test collections are defined in settings:test_options(TEST,...).
  One fact for each collection per TEST.


IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to make the test works, you have to run
generate_benchmark.pl file first.

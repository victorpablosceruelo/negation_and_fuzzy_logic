% In basics get_primes(N,Primes) returns the n-th first prime numbers.
% I have included some directly to be faster. However this puts some
% limit to the number of vars the abstraction can have. Also I have removed 
% some primes from the first nth so that their addition would not result 
% in the same number (to make the hash more effective)

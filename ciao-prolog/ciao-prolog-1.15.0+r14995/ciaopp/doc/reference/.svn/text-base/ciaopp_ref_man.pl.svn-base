@section{How to use this manual}

This is a reference manual. You can use it to look up in it descriptions
for the commands, flags, and options that can be used with CiaoPP. The
Predicate/Method Definition Index may help you in locating commands.
The Regular Type Definition Index may help in locating the definitions of
the types associated to the arguments of commands. The Concept Definition
Index may help in locating the part of the manual where a particular
feature of CiaoPP is described. The Global Index includes all of the
above plus references to pages where the command, type, or concept is
used (not necessarily defined).

This chapter gives a brief overview of CiaoPP and its capabilities.
It assumes some familiarity with the techniques that implement such
functionalities. However, references are included to technical papers
that explain in detail such techniques.  An overview of the
functionalities available is given in @cite{ciaopp-tutorial} in the
form of a tutorial on CiaoPP.

@section{Note}

	We are in the process of merging all CiaoPP functionality into
	the 1.2 version. In the meantime, the current distribution is
	marked as alpha and you may find that some functionality
	documented in this manual is not available or not working
	properly.  Please bear with us in the meantime. Sorry for any
	inconvenience.

@section{Installation (ciaopp)}

Currently there are two Ciao distributions, one which includes CiaoPP,
and another one which does not.  For installing the Ciao distributions
which include CiaoPP, it is sufficient to follow the instructions
enclosed in the Ciao distribution
itself. @include{README_CIAODE.lpdoc}


@section{Getting started}

A CiaoPP session consists in the preprocessing of a file. The session
is governed by a menu, where you can choose the kind of preprocessing
you want to be done to your file among several analyses and program
transformations available.  Clicking on the icon
@image{button-options} in the buffer containing the file to be
preprocessed displays the menu, which will look (depending on the
options available in the current CiaoPP version) something like the
``Preprocessor Option Browser'' shown in the following figure:

 @image{naive-menu}

Except for the first and last lines, which refer to loading or saving
a menu configuration (a predetermined set of selected values for the
different menu options), each line corresponds to an option you can
select, each having several possible values. You can select either
analysis (@tt{analyze}) or assertion checking (@tt{check_assertions})
or certificate checking (@tt{check_certificate}) or program
optimization (@tt{optimize}), and you can later combine the four kinds
of preprocessing.  The relevant options for the @tt{action group}
selected are then shown, together with the relevant flags.  A
description of the values for each option will be given as it is used
in the corresponding section of this manual.

CiaoPP can help you to analyze your program, in order to infer 
properties of the predicates and literals in your program (which might
be useful in the subsequent steps during the same session). You can use
Cost Analysis to infer both lower and upper bounds on the computational 
time cost and sizes of terms of procedures in a program.
Mode Analyses obtain at compile-time accurate variable groundness and sharing
information and other @concept{variable instantiation}
properties. Type Analysis infers regular types. 
Regular types are explained in detail in @ref{Declaring regular types}.
Non-failure and Determinacy Analyses detect procedures and goals that can 
be guaranteed to not fail and/or to be deterministic.

CiaoPP also can help to optimize your program (by means
of source-to-source @index{program transformations}), using
program specialization, partial evaluation, program parallelization and
granularity control, and other program transformations.
Specialization can help to simplify your program w.r.t. the
analysis information (eliminating dead code, predicates that are
guaranteed to either succeed or fail, etc.), specialize it and then
simplify it, or just specialize it, i.e., to unfold all versions of the
predicates in your program. CiaoPP can also perform automatic parallelization 
of your source program during precompilation using several @em{annotation}
algorithms, and granularity control on parallel programs, transforming
the program in order to perform run--time granularity control, i.e., deciding 
parallel or sequential execution of goals depending on the estimated amount of
work under them (estimated by cost analysis).

CiaoPP also helps in @index{debugging} your programs. It makes possible
to perform @index{static debugging}, i.e., finding errors at compile-time, 
before running the program, and also dynamic debugging, in the sense of 
including @index{run-time tests} that will perform the checking for errors
at run-time.
 Static debugging is performed by @index{assertion checking}.
This includes checking the ways in which programs call the system
library predicates and also checking the assertions present in
the program or in other modules used by the program. Such assertions
essentially represent partial @index{specifications} of the program.
For dynamic checking, CiaoPP will include run-time tests for the parts of
assertions which cannot be checked completely at compile-time.

@ref{Using assertions for preprocessing programs}, gives
an overview on the use of the assertion language in CiaoPP.
In that chapter and the following ones, several existing properties that
can be used in assertions are described. Programmers can also define
their own properties (see the abovementioned chapters).

@section{CiaoPP interfaces}

There are three main levels of interaction with CiaoPP.  There is a
graphical menu interface, based on the @apl{emacs} editor, that allows
the selection of configuration options and the use of the different
features of CiaoPP.  If @apl{emacs} is not available, this menu
interface can be used as a text-based menu interface.  There are
several supplementary predicates for assisting the user and providing
a kind of scripting language (based on the Ciao language).  This
interface is described in @ref{The CiaoPP user menu interface}.

The second level of interaction with CiaoPP is the low-level
interface, detailed in @ref{The CiaoPP low-level programming interface}.
This interface is intended for advanced developers, and contains the
primitives used by the abovementioned menu-based interface for
implementing the main features of the system.

And finally, the command-line interface allows the use of CiaoPP
without direct interaction of the user.  With this feature, the CiaoPP
system can be integrated into other systems (as for example
interactive web sites) by means of batch commands.  It is described in
@ref{The CiaoPP command-line interface}.

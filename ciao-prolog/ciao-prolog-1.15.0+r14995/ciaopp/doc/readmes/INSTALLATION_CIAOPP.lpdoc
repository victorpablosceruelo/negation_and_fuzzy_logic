The distribution of CiaoPP consists of its source files, written in Ciao.
Thus, you need to have Ciao (version 1.11 or higher) installed.

Once you have the source files in an installation directory, please,
run the @tt{./ciaosetup configure} utility in order to set the required options
(you can use the option @tt{--help} to know about the command-line options
of that utility; look at the Ciao manual for more information). Then,
run:

@begin{verbatim}
lpmake all
lpmake install
@end{verbatim}
(lpmake is an utility that comes with the Ciao distribution).
This will:
@begin{enumerate}
@item Create an executable @tt{ciaopp} that you can run under Unix.
@item Create an executable @tt{ciaopp.bat} that you can run under Windows.
@item Set up things so that you can use CiaoPP as a library module
      from, e.g., the Ciao shell. In order to do this, please follow
      the (short) instructions that @tt{lpmake install} prints out at the
      end when you run it.
@end{enumerate}

The installation procedure depends on the distribution you have
received (which the types of distributions are available depends a bit
on version of the system).  For installing a (binary) distribution for
Linux/i86, follow the steps below. For installing a (binary)
distribution for Win32 go to item 2. For compiling and installing from
sources under Unix, go to item 3.

@begin{enumerate}
@item To install a binary distribution for Linux/i86:
      @begin{itemize}
      @item Uncompress the distribution files in the installation
            directory.
      @item The file @tt{ciaopp} is the main executable, @tt{ciaoengine} is 
            the Ciao Prolog engine for running on Linux/i86.
      @item Run @tt{gmake}.
            This will update some paths so that @tt{ciaopp} runs using 
            the @tt{ciaoengine} included in the distribution.
      @item Make the path of the installation directory reachable (add it 
            to your @tt{$PATH} variable in @tt{.cshrc} or @tt{.profile}) 
            so that @tt{ciaopp} can be found.
      @end{itemize}
@item To install a binary distribution for Windows:
      @begin{itemize}
      @item Uncompress the distribution files in the installation directory.
      @item The file @tt{ciaopp.bat} is the main executable.
            It uses the MS-DOS variable @tt{CIAOPPROOT} to find dlls and 
            other auxiliary files, which are provided with the distribution.
      @item Set variable @tt{CIAOPPROOT} to the path of the installation
            directory.
      @item Set variable @tt{CIAOLIB} to the path where the Ciao library can be
            found. If you don't have Ciao installed, then set it to the
            same path as @tt{CIAOPPROOT}.
      @item Make that path reachable so that @tt{ciaopp.bat} can be found.
      @end{itemize}
@item To install a complete source distribution for Un*x:
      @begin{itemize}
      @item You will need to have a compatible version of Ciao Prolog 
            installed. Typically the version of Ciao in the same WWW 
            location as the CiaoPP distribution is fully compatible.
      @item Uncompress the distribution files in a source directory.
      @item The distribution contains the sources for CiaoPP, which
            requires the Ciao compiler and libraries for installation.
      @item Make sure that the Ciao compiler and libraries are reachable.
      @item Edit file @tt{SETTINGS} and do the appropriate changes, such as
            defining the installation directory.
      @item Run @tt{gmake install}.
            This will create an executable file @tt{ciaopp} and install 
            it in the installation directory.
      @end{itemize}
@end{enumerate}

A note on @tt{gmake}: it may say that the executable @tt{ciaopp} is
'up to date' when it is not. In that case, just erase the executable
and type @tt{gmake} again.

The CiaoPP manual is included in several public-domain formats
in the @tt{doc} directory of the distribution.

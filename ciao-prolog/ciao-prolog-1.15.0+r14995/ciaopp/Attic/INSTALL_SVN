INSTALL
*******

   This distribution of CiaoPP is formed by a set of Ciao Prolog
source files.  Therefore, Ciao (version 1.11 or higher) must be
installed in order to run CiaoPP.  For the correct generation of the
documentation, also lpdoc (version 2.0) must be installed.

Common users don't need to adapt configuration files to let ciaopp
work, the only thing you must verify is that ciao is available system
wide.  So if you need to know details about how installation works,
the file that contains that information is CIAOPPSETTINGS.pl.

To install CiaoPP just run: 

  lpmake fullinstall 

(lpmake is an utility provided by the Ciao distribution). If CiaoPP is
being upgraded from a previous version, 'lpmake uninstall' must be run
before in the old ciaopp.

lpmake fullinstall will perform the following tasks:

  1. Create an executable `ciaopp' that you can run in the command
     line.

  2. Create an executable that you can run under Windows using
     `ciaopp.bat'. 

  3. Create the documentation files in various formats, in the
     directory doc.

  4. Set up things so that you can use CiaoPP as a library module
     from, e.g., the Ciao shell.

In adition to that, if you are a CiaoPP developer, then you must run:

  lpmake installsrc

or
  lpmake fullinstallsrc, if you want to recreate manuals.

These will do the same things of lpmake install, but ciaopp will be
executed from the source instead of the compiled library.

Note that there is not necessary to reinstall to change these
behavior:

Once ciaopp has been installed (using 'lpmake install', 'lpmake
installsrc', 'lpmake fullinstall' or 'lpmake fullinstallsrc'), if you
run 'lpmake reconfigure' the used ciaopp will be the installed, and if
you run 'lpmake reconfiguresrc' will be the source.

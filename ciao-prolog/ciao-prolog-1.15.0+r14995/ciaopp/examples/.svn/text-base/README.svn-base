This directory contains examples of use of CiaoPP.

Such examples can be grouped in two dimensions, one is by topic,
another one is by "demo session". Though we have often used the second
approach, is has the problem that examples tend to be repeated over
many different demo sessions.

The aim now could be to instead group examples by topic and then
generate demo sessions which use examples from different
directories. For this, we could use the SVN feature which allows
working with symbolic links.

The contents of this directory are:

README           -- this file
Debugging/       -- some examples on debugging
Optimization/    -- some examples on optimization

Overall/         -- an Overall "demo session"
Overall_Extra/   -- additional useful examples not yet included in the
                    above 

Extending/       -- Examples on extending CiaoPP with new analyzers and
                    specializers

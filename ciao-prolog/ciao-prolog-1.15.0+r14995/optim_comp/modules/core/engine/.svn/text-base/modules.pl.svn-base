:- doc(module, "Modularity is a basic notion in a modern computer
   language.  Modules allow dividing programs in several parts, which
   have its own independent name spaces.  The module system in Ciao
   @cite{ciao-modules-cl2000}, as in many other Prolog implementations,
   is procedure based.  This means that predicate names are local to a
   module, but functor/atom names in data are shared.

   The predicates visible in a module are the predicates defined in that
   module, plus the predicates imported from other modules.  Only
   predicates exported by a module can be imported from other modules.
   The default module of a given predicate name is the local one if the
   predicate is defined locally, else the last module from which the
   predicate is imported, having explicit imports priority (that is, a
   predicate imported by an @tt{use_module/2} declaration is always
   preferred above a predicate imported by an @tt{use_module/1}
   declaration).  To refer to a predicate from a module which is not the
   default for that predicate the name has to be module @cindex{module
   qualification}qualified.  A module qualified predicate name has the
   form @var{Module}:@var{Predicate} as in the call
   @tt{debugger:debug_module(M)}.  Note that this does not allow having
   access to predicates not imported, nor defining clauses of other
   modules.

   All predicates defined in files with no module declaration belong to
   a special module called @cindex{user module} @tt{user}, and all are
   implicitly exported.  This allows dividing programs in several files
   without being aware of the module system at all.  Note that this
   feature is only supported for compatibility reasons, being its use
   discouraged.  Many attractive compilation features of Ciao cannot be
   performed in @tt{user} modules.

   The case of multifile predicates (defined with the declaration
   @decl{multifile/1}) is also special.  Multifile predicates can be
   defined by clauses distributed in several modules, and all modules
   which define a predicate as multifile can use that predicate.  The
   name space of multifile predicates is independent, as if they
   belonged to special module @tt{multifile}.

   Every @tt{user} or module file imports implicitly a number of modules
   called @concept{builtin modules}.  They are imported before all other
   importations of the module, allowing thus redefining any of their
   predicates (with the exception of @pred{true/0}) by defining local
   versions or importing them from other modules.  Importing explicitly
   from a builtin module, however, disables the implicit importation of
   the rest (this feature is used by package @lib{library(pure)} to
   define pure prolog code).").

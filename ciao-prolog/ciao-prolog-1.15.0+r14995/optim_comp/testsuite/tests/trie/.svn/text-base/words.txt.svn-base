This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a
regular part of the army.  Tu Mu says: "Your surviving spy must be a
man of keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby
exterior, but with a will of iron.  He must be active, robust, endowed
with physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts
of dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with
shame and ignominy."  Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta`hsi Wu
of the Sui dynasty: "When he was governor of Eastern Ch`in, Shen-wu of
Ch`i made a hostile movement upon Sha-yuan.  The Emperor T`ai Tsu [?
Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy.  He was accompanied by
two other men.  All three were on horseback and wore the enemy's
uniform.  When it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away
from the enemy's camp and stealthily crept up to listen, until they
succeeded in catching the passwords used in the army.  Then they got
on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp under the
guise of night-watchmen; and more than once, happening to come across
a soldier who was committing some breach of discipline, they actually
stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling!  Thus they managed to
return with the fullest possible information about the enemy's
dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor, who in
consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on his
adversary."

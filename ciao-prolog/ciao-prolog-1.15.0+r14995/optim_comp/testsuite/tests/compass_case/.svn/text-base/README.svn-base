Use the commands ./doall.sh or ./do.sh

If you wish to use gumstix compilation you need to have arm-linux-gcc
in your PATH. Gumstix network address and some paths are hardwired
into the scripts.

For local usage:

  ./do.sh 0 compile
  ./do.sh 0 run

0 compiles to bytecode ... 9 is the more optimized code.

For gumstix usage:

  ./do.sh 0 compilegumstix
  ./do.sh 0 sendgumstix
  ./do.sh 0 rungumstix

For gumstix usage with real compass:

  ./do.sh 0 realcomp compilegumstix
  ./do.sh 0 realcomp sendgumstix
  ./do.sh 0 realcomp rungumstix



---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rungumstix has been changed (see do.sh for former versions) BUT NOT
TESTED.  Right now:

    * The compiled program for the gumstix can be run directly on the
    gumstix, by copying it and later starting the sound client
    locally.  They communicate by tcp/ip.  Host numbers and ports are
    hardwired in to_dsp, and only port number in the Prolog
    program.

Example of use:

user@local$ <compile program>
user@local$ scp program.car/arch program.car/noarch root@gumstix:/tmp

[In other window:]

  root@gumstix /tmp/arch /tmp/bbc.sw -C -b /tmp/noarch # Sits waiting

user@local$ ./to_dsp -f 2 -s 10 -r 44100 # Connects to server


NOTE: do.sh updated -- rungumstix should work.  Untested as I have no
gumstix available.

NOTE2: these scripts and programs are only for testing the various
pieces -- programs should in fact be compiled from the Emacs
interface, but they can be sent over

:- doc(summary, "The Ciao System is composed of three main bundles:
Ciao, CiaoPP and LPdoc. Ciao provides a modern, high-performance,
multiparadigm programming language, including a sate-of-the-art
@em{ISO-standard} Prolog system.  CiaoPP is the precompiler of the
Ciao development environment. CiaoPP can perform a number of
program debugging, analysis, and source-to-source transformation tasks
on (Ciao) Prolog programs. LPdoc generates a reference manual
automatically from one or more source files for a logic program
(including ISO-Prolog, Ciao, many CLP systems, ...).").

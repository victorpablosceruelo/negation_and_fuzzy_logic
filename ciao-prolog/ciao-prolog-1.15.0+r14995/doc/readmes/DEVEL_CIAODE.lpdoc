This file provides some random, useful notes for developers who may
wish to contribute to the Ciao library code base. 

@section{The Installation Process}

The entry point of all the install process is the shell utility
@code{./ciaosetup}.

@section{Automatically Generated Modules}

The name of modules that are generated automatically should end in
@code{_auto.pl}. Those modules will be removed when a @tt{realclean}
is done. There are two special cases that should be considered:

@begin{itemize}

 @item If the automatically generated file contains information about
       absolute paths, and needs to be recreated when the CiaoDE
       sources are relocated, then the file should finish in
       @code{_src_auto.pl}.  The generation of such files must be in
       the lpmake environment option of the file @code{installer*.pl}.

 @item If the auto generated file contains information about absolute
       paths, and needs to be recreated when CiaoDE is relocated, then
       the file should finish in @code{_ins_auto.pl}.  This kind of
       files are generated in the @tt{lpmake} reconfigure option of
       the file @code{installer*.pl}.

@end{itemize}

@section{Avoid Module Pre-compilation}

The installation process will find all modules recursivelly and
precompile them. To skip the compilation of the modules in a directory
(and subdirectories) you should create an empty file called
@tt{NOCOMPILE} in such directory. If you need a more refined control
of the compilation, you should create a file @tt{NOCOMPILEFILES}
containing the file patterns that must not be compiled.

@section{Avoid Module Distribution}

To indicate that some directory must not be included in a @em{packaged
bundle}, you should create an empty file called @tt{NODISTRIBUTE} in
such directory.

@section{Avoid Module Installation}

To indicate that some directory must not be copied during installation
(i.e., during the execution of the @tt{./ciaosetup install} option),
you should create the empty file @tt{NOINSTALL} in such directory.

@section{Source Cleaning}

@code{./ciaosetup} provides several options to cleanning the sources.
The strongest is realclean, which leaves the source code as obtained
from svn.

@code{./ciaosetup recursiveclean} can be invoked inside any
subdirectory to clean all the auto generated files.

Remember that if @tt{instype} is @tt{local}, uninstallation does not
delete any files, it only removes the configuration settings in shell
scripts and emacs initialization files.

@section{Customization of Installation Output}

Sometimes when you are creating binary packaged bundles, or simply
testing installation, you require to simulate the installation in a
directory other than root, but without to change the links and file
references, considering that such precompiled packaged bundle should
work well when be moved to the root of the machine.  To do that,
before to call the @tt{./ciaosetup install} tool you should export the
variable @tt{ROOTPREFIX} pointing to the directory taken as root for
the fake installation.

@section{Generating Distribution Packages}

@tt{./ciaosetup} offers some commands to generate packaged bundles for
several platforms with the command @code{gen_pbundle TYPE}, where
@tt{TYPE} is one of:

@begin{itemize}

@item @code{win32}: Creates a Windows installer.

@item @code{rpm [--option=value...]}: Creates an @tt{RPM} package.
	One or more options may be added; main ones are:

	@begin{description}

	@item{subpackages=yes} Creates separate packages, one for each
		component, plus a CiaoDE metapackage that depends on
		all of them. If disabled only a single package is
		created with the whole bundle.

	@item{versionp=yes} Creates versioned packages instead of
		regular ones.  Versioned packages are meant to coexist
		with older or newer ones.  Each package gets labeled
		with the component's main version (e.g. -v1.14) and
		can be installed together with the regular package or
		other versioned packages, provided they are all
		different versions.  This needs @tt{subpackages=yes}.

	@item{vendor_independent=yes} Creates packages that should
		work in all mainstream @tt{RPM} Linux distributions.
		This is the default.  If disabled, packages are only
		guaranteed to work in the same distribution (vendor)
		they were generated for.

	@item{svn_sources=yes} Builds CiaoDE straight from subversion
		repository sources instead of a distribution tarball.

	@end{description}

	For more details please read the documentation for the
	@code{gen_pbundle__rpm} module.

@item @code{bin}: Creates the binary packages (using @tt{gz}
	and @tt{bzip2}).

@item @code{bin_tgz}: Creates the binary package compressed
	using @tt{gz}.

@item @code{bin_tbz}: Creates the binary package compressed
	using @tt{bzip2}.

@item @code{src}: Creates the @tt{tar} packages in @tt{gz} and @tt{bzip2}
	compressed formats.

@item @code{tgz}: Creates the @tt{tar} packages in @tt{gz}
	compressed format.

@item @code{tbz}: Creates the @tt{tar} packages in
	@tt{bzip2} compressed format.

@end{itemize}

@section{Adding new Java Examples to the Cost Analysis}

The new examples must be in the directory
@file{ciaopp/ilciao/examples/Resources}, and if at this point, such
examples are located in subdirectories, is necessary to update the
target @code{clean} in the @file{build.xml} file.

@comment{ @apl{lpdoc} can be obtained as either a source or binary
          distribution. }

The source and binaries distributions of @apl{lpdoc} are currently
included in @apl{Ciao} (@href{http:://ciaohome.org}). Please, refer to
the @apl{Ciao} installation instructions for more details regarding
the building and installation process.

@section{Other software packages required (lpdoc)}

The most basic functionality of @apl{lpdoc} (generating manuals in
@tt{.texi} format, short manual entries in @tt{.manl} format,
generating @em{index} files) is essentially self contained.  However,
using the full capabilities of @apl{lpdoc} requires having several
other software packages installed in the system. Fortunately, all of
these packages are public domain software and they will normally be
already installed in, e.g., a standard @apl{Linux} distribution. It
should be relatively easy to get and install the required packages in
other Unix-like packages or even in Windows, under the Cygwin
environment.

@begin{itemize} 

@item @bf{Generating} @tt{.dvi} @bf{files:} @apl{lpdoc} normally
      generates @tt{.texi} files (actually, a number of @tt{.texic}
      files). From the @tt{.texi} files, @tt{.dvi} files are generated
      using the standard @apl{tex} package directly. The @tt{.dvi}
      files can also be generated with the GNU @apl{Texinfo} package,
      which provides, among others, the @apl{texi2dvi}
      command. However, @apl{Texinfo} itself requires the standard
      @apl{tex} document processing package. 

      @comment{ In order to use
      @apl{texi2dvi} instead of @apl{tex} when processing documents
      you should change the variable @tt{TEX} in the
      @tt{Makefile.skel} file in the @tt{lib} directory before
      installing @apl{lpdoc}. }

      Generating the @tt{.dvi} file requires that the @tt{texinfo.tex}
      file (containing the relevant macros) be available to
      @apl{tex}. This file is normally included with modern @apl{tex}
      distributions, although it may be obsolete. An appropriate and
      up-to-date one for @apl{lpdoc} is provided with the @tt{lpdoc}
      distribution, stored in the @tt{lpdoc} library during
      installation, and used automatically when @apl{lpdoc} runs
      @apl{tex}. The @apl{texindex} package is required in order to
      process the indices. If you use @concept{references} in your
      manual, then the @apl{bibtex} package is also
      needed. @apl{texindex} and @apl{bibtex} are included with most
      @apl{tex} distributions.

@item @bf{Generating} @tt{.ps} @bf{files:} @tt{.ps} files are
      generated from the @tt{.dvi} files using the @apl{dvips} command
      (this, again, can be changed in the @tt{Makefile.skel} file in the
      @tt{lib} directory).  This command is included with standard
      @apl{tex} distributions.

@item @bf{Generating} @tt{.pdf} @bf{files:} @tt{.pdf} files are
      currently generated from the @tt{.texi} file using the
      @apl{pdftex} command (this, again, can be changed in the
      @tt{Makefile.skel} file in the @tt{lib} directory).  This
      command is included in current @apl{Linux} distributions.

@item @bf{Generating} @tt{.info} @bf{files:} @tt{.info} files are also
      generated directly from the @tt{.texi} file using the
      @apl{makeinfo} command (this, again, can be changed in the
      @tt{Makefile.skel} file in the @tt{lib} directory).  This
      command is included in the @apl{Texinfo} distribution.
      Resolving the link references in the @tt{.texi} file is also
      required as above.

@item @bf{Generating} @tt{.html} @bf{files:} @tt{.html} files are
      generated directly from the HTML @apl{lpdoc} backend.

@item If pictures are used in the manual, the command @apl{convert}
      (@href{http://www.imagemagick.org}{ImageMagick}) is required in
      order to convert figures from several common graphical formats.

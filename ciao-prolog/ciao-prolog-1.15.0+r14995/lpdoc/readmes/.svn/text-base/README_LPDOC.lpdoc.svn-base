@apl{lpdoc} is an @em{automatic program documentation generator} for
(C)LP systems.

@apl{lpdoc} generates a reference manual automatically from one or
more source files for a logic program (including ISO-Prolog, Ciao,
many CLP systems, ...).  It is particularly useful for documenting
library modules, for which it automatically generates a description of
the module interface. However, @apl{lpdoc} can also be used quite
successfully to document full applications and to generate nicely
formatted plain ascii ``readme'' files. A fundamental advantage of
using @apl{lpdoc} to document programs is that it is much easier to
maintain a true correspondence between the program and its
documentation, and to identify precisely to what version of the
program a given printed manual corresponds.

The quality of the documentation generated can be greatly enhanced by
including within the program text:

@begin{itemize}

@item @em{assertions} (types, modes, etc. ...) for the predicates in
the program, and 

@item @em{machine-readable comments} (in the ``literate programming''
style). 

@end{itemize}

The assertions and comments included in the source file need to be
written using the Ciao system @em{assertion language}.  A simple
compatibility library is available to make traditional (constraint)
logic programming systems ignore these assertions and comments
allowing normal treatment of programs documented in this way.

The documentation is currently generated in @apl{HTML} or
@apl{texinfo} format. From the @apl{texinfo} output, printed and
on-line manuals in several formats (dvi, ps, info, etc.) can be easily
generated automatically, using publicly available tools. @apl{lpdoc}
can also generate 'man' pages (Unix man page format) as well as brief
descriptions in html or emacs info formats suitable for inclusion in
an on-line index of applications.  In particular, @apl{lpdoc} can
create and maintain fully automatically @concept{WWW} and
@concept{info} sites containing on-line versions of the documents it
produces.

The @apl{lpdoc} manual (and the Ciao system manuals) are generated
by @apl{lpdoc}.

@apl{lpdoc} is distributed under the @concept{GNU general public
license}.

@noindent @bf{Note}: @apl{lpdoc} is fully supported on Linux, Mac OS
X, and other Un*x-like systems. Due to the use of several Un*x-related
utilities, some documentation back-ends may require @tt{Cygwin} under
Win32.

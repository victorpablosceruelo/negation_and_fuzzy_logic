Notes about the migration from lpdoc-1.9 to lpdoc-2.0
=====================================================

This program has been created to facilitate the migration from
lpdoc-1.9 to lpdoc-2.0 of documentation projects.

Is important to have in mind that these files can't solve all the
dependencies, and sometimes is necessary to improve by hand the
resulting file.

The instructions to use it are the next:

1. compile the convert.pl program:

   ciaoc convert

2. Check that the file SETTINGS_HEAD.pl have the things that you
   require in the header of your auto generated files.

3. copy the files convert, migrate and SETTINGS_HEAD.pl in your
   lpdoc-1.9 project that you want to migrate to lpdoc-2.0.

4. execute the next command that will try to migrate all the SETTINGS
   file to LPSETTINGS.pl files:

find . -name SETTINGS -exec migrate {} \;

This program has been tested migrating ciao documentation from
lpdoc-1.9 to lpdoc-2.0 and worked well.

   @begin{itemize}
   @item Major redesign of the documentation generator:
         @begin{itemize}
         @item LPdoc redesigned to work internally with a 'doctree'
               representation (a-la Pillow). (Jose Morales)
         @item A native HTML backend (not generated from texi). (Jose
               Morales)
         @item Allow custom website generation from LPdoc documents.
               (Jose Morales)
         @item Two passes for document generation, allowing resolution
               of bibliographical references in all backends
               (including HTML). (Jose Morales)
         @item @tt{doc_structure/1} in @tt{SETTINGS} allows structure
               in LPdoc documents (sections can really be nested
               inside parts). (Jose Morales)
         @item @tt{:- doc(_,_)} is the recommended syntax for
               documentation comments now.
         @item Replacing @tt{:- comment} by @tt{:- doc} in LPdoc code,
               updated documentation. (Jose Morales)
         @end{itemize}

   @item General improvements and bug fixes:
         @begin{itemize}
         @item Designed a logo for LPdoc. (Jose Morales)
         @item LPdoc comments can now be written using @tt{%!}
               style comment syntax. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Now commas etc. are allowed in section names (so that
               they can be used in other formats). They are eliminated
               automatically in texi and info. This avoids wrong
               section names --and thus dangling pointers-- in
               generated texinfo files. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Eliminated superfluous copy of summary in info mode.
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Eliminated unsupported chars that broke texi manual
               cross-referencing. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Improved treatment of accents (dotless i and dotless j,
               \o, etc.). (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Initial size passed to @tt{xdvi} more appropriate for
               current @tt{xdvis}. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Accents in bibliography fixed.  (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Now repeated sections are disambiguated. (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)
         @item Eliminated unnecessary escaping (especially for
               &). (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Better detection of when version is not
               available. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Added new @tt{doc(address, _)} comment, which is the
               right place to put address/contact information in
               manuals (Jose Morales)
         @item Added new @tt{@@version@{@}} command (expands to the
               version of the software to be documented). (Jose
               Morales)
         @item Shorter @tt{SETTINGS.pl} files (with some rudimentary,
               assertion-based checking of options) (Jose Morales)
         @item Bug fix: '@tt{@@@@ include}' and '@tt{@@@@
               includeverbatim}' are no longer a problem (space can be
               omitted) (Jose Morales)
         @item Added and documented a new @tt{documentation} filetype
               (for some parts of the manual that contains only
               documentation). That avoids the old trick of declaring
               a fake @tt{main/0} predicate. (Jose Morales)
         @item Style for subtitle added automatically (in texinfo, it
               is @em{emph}; in HTML it is normal text with smaller
               font). The entries in @tt{subtitle_extra} are
               free-form. (Jose Morales)
         @item Bugs and changelog appear now in the global links in
               the HTML backend. (Jose Morales)
         @item Merged code that documented @tt{.pl} and @tt{.lpdoc}
               files. (Jose Morales)
         @item No copyright section if no copyright comment. (Jose Morales)
         @item Auxiliary documentation files ending in '@tt{_doc}'
               displayed incorrect names for the module (ending in
               '@tt{_doc}'). E.g., @tt{use_package(foo_doc)} was
               displayed instead of
               @tt{use_package(foo_doc)}. Fixed. (Jose Morales)
         @item In @tt{verbatim} enviroments, new-line characters are
               removed from the beginning. (Jose Morales)
         @item Fix wrong use of @tt{erase/1} for clauses (which
               resulted in segmentation fault when documentation
               generation failed) (Jose Morales)
         @item Fixed image generation (now uses @tt{.png} files for
               HTML) (Jose Morales)
         @item New code for text escape fixed some problems, like
               '@tt{@@/1}' operator not being displayed corretly in
               Info. (Jose Morales)
         @item Colors for Prolog variables (in HTML). (Jose Morales)
         @item Added @tt{@@begin@{alert@}} environment for alert
               messages (like cartouche, but in red). (Jose Morales)
         @item Supporting '@@\"' command for umlaut, in addition to
               '@@..'  (Jose Morales)
         @item Double quotes correctly translated to HTML (Jose Morales)
         @item @tt{@@author} command to reference authors (changed
               @index command referring to people by @tt{@@author}, in
               all the documentation) (Jose Morales)
         @item Simplification of documentation setting files (see the
               documentation for further details) (Jose Morales)
         @item Using @tt{open} for @tt{lpdoc htmlview} command in
               MacOS X (Jose Morales)
         @item Adding @tt{html} and @tt{pdf} formats as options for
               emacs customization of LPdoc (@tt{html} is the default
               one now) (Jose Morales)
         @item Improved detection of external tools for image
               conversion. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Added section name syntax auto-correction. This avoids
               wrong section names --and thus dangling pointers-- in
               generated texinfo files. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Document size more appropriate for current xdvi
               versions. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
         @item Lpdoc no longer adds .info filename suffix to
               .infoindex entries since it breaks Debian's
               install-info --remove and goes against standard
               practice anyway. (Jose Luis Gonzalez)
         @item Added option --cv, --comment-version, that tells lpdoc
               if the file has version comment. Formatting of lpdoc
               version comments completed. (Edison Mera)
         @item Improved handling of option values. Added -d option to
               lpdoc, that allows defining additional values in the
               argument. Added options -l and -m that are similar to
               the corresponding lpmake options.  (Edison Mera)
         @end{itemize}

   @item Support for in-code sections (experimental):
         @begin{itemize}
         @item Latex-like font-lock highlight of sectioning
               documentation comments (@tt{:- doc(C, \"...\")}, with
               @tt{C} one of @tt{title}, @tt{section}, and
               @tt{subsection}).

               Currently the @tt{section} and @tt{subsection}
               comments are still ignored by LPdoc.  (Jose Morales)
         @end{itemize}

   @item Support for mathematical notation (experimental):
         @begin{itemize}
         @item new @@math@{...@} and
               @@begin@{displaymath@}...@@end@{displaymath@}
               enviroments are supported (see the documentation for
               more details) (Jose Morales)
         @item In documentation strings, single @tt{\\} must be
               escaped (e.g. '@@math@{\\\\lambda@}') (Jose Morales)
         @item Supported in both the texinfo and HTML (using MathJax)
               backends. (Jose Morales)
         @item Added @tt{@@defmathcmd@{Cmd@}@{N@}@{Def@}} and
               @tt{@@defmathcmd@{Cmd@}@{Def@}}, both for texinfo and
               HTML backends. Those LPdoc commands define new

         @item Made xdvi viewer, ps viewer, and xdvi zoom size be
               paramenters (the latter since new versions of xdvi
               display sizes differently than old ones).  (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

         @item Processing options can now be set for each file
               independently.  (Manuel Hermenegildo)

         @item Proper @concept{pdf generation} now achieved in most
               cases, thanks to newer versions of @apl{dvips}.
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

         @item Added option -c Target in lpdoc, that treats Target as
               a separate component.  (Edison Mera) @item Added option
               -f ConfigFile in lpdoc, that uses the file ConfigFile
               instead the default LPSETTINGS.pl.  (Edison Mera)

         @item Added option ascii that generates documentation in
               ascii plain format.  (Edison Mera)

         @item Added --help option. Is equal to -h.  (Edison Mera)

         @item Added option testsettings to check that the settings
               file is correctly specified.  (Edison Mera)

         @item Changed @pred{generate_html_pointer/5} by

               sicne recent versions handle @tt{pdf} well.  (Manuel

               lines with a monospaced font.  (Daniel Cabeza Gras)

         @item Mode definitions now documented in a separate

               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

         @item References in files now updated only if @tt{.refs} file
               is not empty.  (Manuel Hermenegildo)

         @item Accented i's now translate correctly in html.  (Manuel

         @item Fixed a funny installation quirk: while we want to
               install LPdoc in the Ciao group, the manuals produced
               by LPdoc should be installed in the LPdoc group.

   In this release the name of the application has changed to @apl{lpdoc}.

   @begin{itemize}
   @item New commands:
         @begin{itemize}
         @item @@begin@{cartouche@} and @@end@{cartouche@} commands
               now supported.
         @item @@foonote command now supported.
         @item New @tt{gmake htmlview} command (makes a running
               @apl{netscape} visit the generated html
               manual). Suggested by Per Cederberg.
         @item New @tt{gmake distclean} command, intended for software
               distributions. Leaves the generated documents and
               eliminates @em{all} intermediate files (including
               @tt{.texic}/@tt{.texi} files).
         @item Adobe @tt{pdf} format now supported as a valid
               target. Unfortunately, embedded @tt{.eps} figures are
               not supported at this time in pdf output.
         @item The second argument of @tt{:- comment(hide,...).} and
               @tt{:- comment(doinclude,...).} declarations can now be
               a list of predicate names.
         @item A @tt{-u} @em{File} option is now supported so that a
               file including, e.g., path alias definitions can be
               included (this has the same functionality as the
               @tt{-u} option in @apl{ciaoc}).
         @item Now typing just @tt{gmake} does nothing. In order to do
               something at least one target should be specified. This
               was necessary so that recursive invocations with empty
               arguments did nothing.
         @item Added a new filetype: @tt{part}. This allows splitting
               large documents into parts, each of which groups a
               series of chapters.
         @end{itemize}

   @item Other new functionality:
   	 @begin{itemize}
   	 @item A style sheet can now be specified which allows modifying
   	       many characteristics of the html output (fonts, colors,
   	       background, ...) (thanks to Per Cederberg).
   	 @item Added limited support for changing page numbering (in
   	       @file{SETTINGS} file).
   	 @item The concept indexing commands (@@index, @@cindex, and
   	       @@concept) now work somewhat differently, to make them
   	       consistent with other indexing commands.
   	 @item The old @em{usage} index is now called, more appropriately,
   	       @em{global} index. Correspondingly, changed things so that
   	       now every definition goes to the global index in addition to
   	       its definitional index.
   	 @item Imported files from module @tt{user} are now documented
   	       separately.
   	 @item Now a warning is issued if characters unsupported by info are
   	       used in section names.
   	 @item Navigation in html docs was improved.
   	 @item The table of contents in printed manuals now contains entries
   	       for the individual descriptions of predicates, props,
   	       regtypes, declarations, etc.  This can be shut off with the
   	       @tt{-shorttoc} option.
   	 @item Made more silent in normal conditions: file inclusion is
   	       muted now unless @tt{-v} option is selected.
   	 @item A single @tt{.texi} file is now constructed (by grouping the
   	       @tt{.texic} files generated for all components) in which the
   	       references and menus are resolved. This has the advantage
   	       that the process of resolving references and menus has now
   	       been sped up very significantly.  Also, @tt{texi} is now a
   	       valid target (perhaps useful for distributions). The
   	       generated files now have @tt{texic} (@em{texinfo component}).
   	 @item Now, declarations are always documented as long as there is a
   	       @tt{decl} assertion.  Also, they are now documented in a
   	       separate section.
   	 @end{itemize}

   @item Bug fixes and other minor improvements:
   	 @begin{itemize}
   	 @item The directory containing html manual is now called
   	       @em{BASENAME}@tt{_html} instead of just @em{BASENAME}, which
   	       was confusing.
   	 @item Now requesting building a .ps only does not leave a .dvi
   	       behind (useful for distributions).
   	 @item File names can now include the symbol @tt{_} even if they
   	       contain figures.
   	 @item @apl{TeX}-related intermediate files are now cleaned up after
   	       each run in order to avoid clutter.
   	 @item Fixed @tt{-modes}, which was broken since going to the new
   	       normalizer (was normalizer problem). Fixed problem with no
   	       documentation when only modes given.
   	 @item Fixed duplication of documentation for internal predicates
   	       when also exported.
   	 @item Minor formatting problem when no documentation nor definition
   	       found for a regtype fixed.
   	 @item Determining exports, imports, etc. now done solely by calls
   	       to @lib{c_itf} library (and, thus, synchronized with
   	       @apl{ciaoc} compiler).
   	 @end{itemize}

   This version completes the port to using the ciao 0.8 modular
   assertion processing library. In addition, it includes the
   following improvements:

   @begin{itemize}
   @item Now, if the name of a file being documented ends in
         @tt{_doc}, the @tt{_doc} part is left out when referring to
         the file in the documentation (useful if one would like to
         place the documentation declarations in different file).
   @item It is now possible to declare (via a @decl{comment/2}
         declaration) the intended use of a file which is not a module
         (i.e. a package, user, or include file), which results in
         correct documentation of operator definitions, new
         declarations, etc. The declaration is only needed for 'user'
         files (i.e., files to be loaded with @pred{ensure_loaded/1}).
   @item Separated generation of the manuals from their
         installation. I.e., @tt{gmake install} now does not force a
         @tt{gmake all}, which has to be done by hand. This was
         necessary to ensure correct installation of distributed
         manuals, even if modification dates are changed during
         installation. Previously, in some cases generation was
         triggered unnecessarily.
   @item New @tt{-v} option allows using quieter by default operation
         when not debugging.
   @item New option @tt{-propmods} makes the name of the module in
         which a property is defined appear in front of the property
         in the places where the property is used.
   @item New option @tt{-noisoline} makes the textual explanation of
         the @prop{iso/1} property not appear in the description of
         the usage (but the @iso symbol does appear)
   @item Two new options, @tt{-nosysmods} and @tt{-noengmods},
         selectively avoid listing the system or engine libraries
         used.
   @item If there is no declaration for a predicate, now a line is
         output with the name and arity and a simple comment saying
         that there is no further documentation available (this has
         the great advantage that then it goes in the index, and, for
         example in ciao, they get added to completion commands!).
   @item Now, if a property or regtype declaration has no textual
         comment, the actual definition is given (first level only) in
         the place where it is documented, and a simple generic
         message where it is used.
   @item Added @@noindent and @@iso commands.
   @item Nicer spacing now when printing predicate names which are
         operators, as well as modes, etc.
   @item Reporting of versions in libraries has been improved: now
         both the global version and the last version in which the
         library itself was changed are reported.
   @item Exported new declarations also documented now for
         include-type files.
   @item A module is now documented even if exports nothing at all.
   @item Engine modules used now documented even if no other modules
         used (was a reported bug).
   @item Fixed indexing of names containing @@ etc. for newer versions
         of texinfo.
   @item Tabs in verbatim modes now converted to a number of spaces
         (8). Not perfect, but produces better output than leaving the
         tabs in.
   @item Tex is now run in 'nonstopmode' which means it will typically
         not stop if there are minor errors (but some errors may go
         unnoticed...).
   @item The full path of the version maintenance directory is now
         computed (correctly) using the directory of the @tt{.pl} file
         being documented as base.
   @item Notices for missing subtitle, copyright, and summary now only
         given from main file and not for components.
   @item Added special handling of regtype and generalized it to
         handle some props specially if there is a certain comp
         property present.
   @end{itemize}

   and @concept{url references} via @@uref command.

   Unix 'man' output much improved. Also, it now includes a
   @concept{usage section}. The correspoding text must be given in a
   string contained in the first argument of a fact of the
   @pred{usage_message/1} predicate which appears in the
   program. Also, formatting of 'man' pages has been greatly improved.

   A new 'ascii' format is now supported: a simple minded ascii manual
   (basically, an info file without pointers).

   Now supporting a @@cite command (YES!). It automatically accesses
   the bib entries in @tt{.bib} files (using @apl{bibtex}) and
   produces a 'References' appendix. @@cite can be used in the text
   strings exactly as \cite in LaTeX. The set of bib files to be used
   is given in the @tt{SETTINGS} file.

   Defining the type of version maintenance that should be performed
   by the @apl{emacs} ciao.el mode (i.e., whether version numbers are
   in a given directory or in the file itself) is controlled now via a
   standard @decl{commment/2} declaration. You should now write a
   declaration such as:

     @tt{:- comment(version_maintenance,dir('../version')).}

   to state that control info is kept in directory
   @tt{../version}. This has the advantage that it is shorter than the
   previous solution and that lpdoc can read this info easily. Using
   this guarantees that the version numbers of the manuals always
   concide with those of the software.

   Generation of indices of manuals (.htmlbullet files): if several
   manuals are installed in the same directory, an index to them is
   now generated at the beginning of the html cover page describing
   the directory.

   is not needed any more in, e.g, @@include command.  

   New @@ref command which can be used to refer to chapeter, sections,
   subsections, etc..

   Support for recent minor changes in assertion format, including '#'
   as comment separator.

   Used modules are now separated in documentation (in the interface
   description) by type (user, system, engine...).  

   Supports new 'hide' option in comments, to prevent an exported
   predicate from being documented. This is useful for example for
   avoiding mentioning in the documentation multifile predicates which
   are not intended to be modified by the user.

                     TESTS FOR THE JS BACKEND

This directory contains tests that exercise different language
features of the JS-backend (like the module system, classes,
inheritance, attributed variables, etc.).

Ideally, they should be integrated with the rest of language tests
(for *any* backend), as the JS-backend is more and more
Ciao-compatible.

At this point, some tests are stubs and do really exhaustive.

How to execute the tests:

$ ciaotool js-backend regr-all

NOTE: Tests run from a terminal. The default target platform for tests
   with the JS-backend is NodeJS (http://nodejs.org), itself based on
   V8 (http://code.google.com/p/v8/).

- read_record_file/4 generates:
  * While reading file:
    defines_module/2
    decl/2
    uses/2
    adds/2
    uses_builtins/1
    imports_all_1/2 (by store_imports/5, used also by use_mod/3)

    includes/2
    loads/2
    clause_of/7 (before also in check_itf_data/2 to make bridge predicates)

  * Just after closing:
    exports/5 (by gen_exports/1, consumes exports_pred/3)
    def_multifile/4 (by gen_def_multifile/1, consumes multifile_pred/3)

- check_itf_data/2 (done just before treating file and creating itf) generates:
+   imports_pred_1/6 (by gen_imports/1)

- generate_module_data/2 (done while treating file) generates:
+   imports/5
    meta_args/2
    multifile/4
    defines/3

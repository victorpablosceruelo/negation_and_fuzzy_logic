   special has to be done to use them.").

:- doc(module, "Modularity is a basic notion in a modern computer
   language.  Modules allow dividing programs in several parts, which
   have its own independent name spaces.  The module system in CIAO, as
   in many other Prolog implementations, is procedure based.  This means
   that predicate names are local to a module, but functor/atom names in
   data are shared.

   The predicates visible in a module are the predicates defined in that
   module, plus the predicates imported from other modules.  Only
   predicates exported by a module can be imported from other modules.
   The default module of a given predicate name is the local one if the
   predicate is defined locally, else the first module from which the
   predicate is imported.  To refer to a predicate from a module which
   is not the default for that predicate the name has to be module
   @cindex{module qualification}qualified.  A module qualified predicate
   name has the form @var{Module}:@var{Predicate} as in the call
   @tt{debugger:debug_module(M)}.  Note that this does not allow having
   access to predicates not imported, nor defining clauses of other
   modules.

   When a module exports a predicate which is not defined in the module,
   but imported from other module, a @index{bridge predicate} is
   automatically added which connects the exported predicate and the
   imported predicate.  Note that this makes that the exported predicate
   does not inherit the dynamic properties of the imported predicate.

   All predicates defined in files with no module declaration belong to
   a special module called @cindex{user module} @tt{user}, and all are
   implicitly exported.  This allows dividing programs in several files
   without being aware of the module system at all.  Note that this
   feature is only supported for compatibility reasons, being its use
   discouraged.  Many attractive compilation features of CIAO cannot be
   performed in @tt{user} modules.

   The case of multifile predicates (defined with the declaration
   @decl{multifile/1}) is also special.  Multifile predicates can be
   defined by clauses in several modules, and all modules which define a
   predicate as multifile can use that predicate.  The name space of
   multifile predicates is independent, as if they belonged to special
   module @tt{multifile}.

   Every @tt{user} or module file imports implicitly a number of modules
   called @concept{builtin modules}.  They are imported after all other
   importations of the module, allowing thus redefining any of their
   predicates (with the exception of @pred{true/0}) by defining local
   versions or importing them from other modules.  Importing explicitly
   from a builtin module, however, disables the implicit importation of
   the rest (this feature is used by package @lib{library(pure)} to
   define pure prolog code).").

          file where the module resides, without extension.  For each

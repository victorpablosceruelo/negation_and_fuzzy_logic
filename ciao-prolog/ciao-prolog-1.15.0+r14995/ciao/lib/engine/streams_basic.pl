   to a concrete file. A source name is either a relative or absolute
   filename given as:

@begin{itemize}

@item an atom, or

@item a unary functor (which represents a @index{path alias}, see
      below) applied to a @em{relative} path, the latter being given
      as an atom.

@end{itemize}

In all cases certain filename extensions (e.g., @tt{.pl}) can be
implicit.  In the first form above, file names can be relative to the
current directory.  Also, file names beginning with @tt{~} or @tt{$}
are treated specially.  For example,

@begin{description}

@item{@tt{'~/ciao/sample.pl'}}
is equivalent to @tt{'/home/staff/herme/ciao/sample.pl'}, if
@tt{/home/staff/herme} is the user's home directory.  (This is also
equivalent to @tt{'$HOME/ciao/sample.pl'} as explained below.)

@item{@tt{'~bardo/prolog/sample.pl'}}
is equivalent to @tt{'/home/bardo/prolog/sample.pl'}, if
@tt{/home/bardo} is bardo's home directory.

@item{@tt{'$UTIL/sample.pl'}}
is equivalent to @tt{'/usr/local/src/utilities/sample.pl'}, if
@tt{/usr/local/src/utilities} is the value of the environment variable
@tt{UTIL}.

@end{description}

   The second form allows using path aliases. Such aliases allow
   refering to files not with absolute file system paths but with
   paths which are relative to predefined (or user-defined) abstract
   names.  For example, given the path alias @tt{myutils} which has
   been defined to refer to path @tt{'/home/bardo/utilities'}, if that
   directory contains the file @tt{stuff.pl} then the term
   @tt{myutils(stuff)} in a @decl{use_module/1} declaration would
   refer to the file @tt{'/home/bardo/utilities/stuff.pl'} (the
   @tt{.pl} extension is implicit in the @decl{use_module/1}
   declaration).  As a special case, if that directory contains a
   subdirectory named @tt{stuff} which in turn contains the file
   @tt{stuff.pl}, the same term would refer to the file
   @tt{'/home/bardo/utilities/stuff/stuff.pl'}.  If a path alias is
   related to several paths, all paths are scanned in sequence until a
   match is found.  For information on predefined path aliases or how
   to define new path aliases, see @pred{file_search_path/2}.  ").

- Objectives:

  a) Find out which predicates have side-effects and describe what
     they do.

     Approach:

     - Transform all preds so that they have two extra arguments, as a
       preprocessing before the CiaoPP analyses. This can be done:

       - Inside CiaoPP, in the first stages.
       - For now, for experimentation, as an expansion.

     - Then, run certain analyses on this program.
       - Start with the existing type analyses.
       - Develop specific analyses.

   b) Do the Mercury-like thing: the user explicitly says that a
      certain predicate is pure (by using <-). 

- bf  (and bfall)
  These packages define breadth-first execution.
  They distinguish bf from depth-first predicates using 
  <- instead of   :-

  The idea is to do the same to distinguish 'pure' from 'impure'
  predicates.

p(X) :- write(X), q(X).

would then get translated to 

p(X,I,O) :- write(X,I,O1), q(X,O1,O).

and 

p(X) <- write(X), q(X).

would get translated to 

p(X) :- write(X), q(X).

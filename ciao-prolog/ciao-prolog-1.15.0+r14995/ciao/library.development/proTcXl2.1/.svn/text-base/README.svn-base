This is ProTcXl (pronounced pro-ticksle), the Prolog interface to Tcl/Tk,
and Xlib, version 2.0. It is a rather lightweight interface, it allows to
evaluate Tcl expressions in Prolog handle Tk events in Prolog, call Prolog
from Tcl and also to invoke Xlib functions from Prolog.

This version corresponds to Tcl7.4/Tk4.0. The distribution
of these Tcl/Tk versions may be found in ftp.ecrc.de:/pub/eclipse/progs
or e.g. in ftp.smli.com:/pub/tcl.

To find out more about Tcl/Tk, read the README files in the Tcl/Tk
distribution.

The interface has been tested with ECLiPSe 3.5 on a Sparc 10.
I no longer check it with SICStus since it became quite a lot
ECLiPSe-dependent and SICStus has its own interface now.

The software is delivered as is, without any explicit or implied warranty.
Questions regarding Tcl/Tk itself can be sent to the Usenet group
comp.lang.tcl, questions regarding Prolog to comp.lang.prolog,
ECLiPSe questions to eclipse_users@ecrc.de.

Bugs and suggestions please to micha@ecrc.de.

Installation
------------

1) Install Tcl and Tk. This is usually done in /usr/local, but it can
   be any directory you like. It can be in the eclipse directory tree
   but it makes more sense to install it on its own, because it is
   a general independent package.
2) When you obtain ECLiPSe 3.5.2 or later, ProTcXl source should already be
   in the distribution, in the protcl directory. If it is not there,
   or if you want to update with a newer ProTcXl release, unpack
   the protcl2.*.tar file in the $ECLIPSEDIR/protcl directory
   (create it if it is not there).
   As a matter of fact, any subdirectory of the eclipse distribution,
   e.g. lib_graphic would do as well. The only necessary condition
   is that when you cd to the protcl2.* directory, lib_graphic
   is in ../..
3) Set the ARCH environment variable to the string you obtain from
   get_flag(hostarch, ARCH) in ECLiPSe.
4) cd to the protcl2.* directory and run ./configure.
   Configure recognizes the following options:

	inst=DIR
		DIR is the directory or list of directories where Tcl
		and Tk are installed, e.g. /usr/local. This directory
		should contain subdirectories lib and include with
		the installed Tcl/Tk files. If Tcl/Tk is installed
		differently, without a common root for all the files,
		simply supply all the necessary directories.
	eclipse
		Make an eclipse configuration, default.
	sicstus
		Make a sicstus configuration.
	quintus
		Make a quintus configuration.

   So e.g. to configure ProTcl for sicstus use
	./configure sicstus
   Configure tries to locate Tcl/Tk and X11 in usual places. If it
   does not find it, you can specify the 'inst' parameter or
   modify the Makefile after configuration.

   If your Tcl/Tk or X11 installation is in a non-standard path, you might
   have to change some paths in the Makefile.
5) To install ProTcXl as an ECLiPSe library, type 'make install'.
   This will compile the ProTcXl files and move them to the lib_graphic
   directory of eclipse, so that the interface can be loaded with
	:- lib(tk).
   or
	:- use_module(library(tk)).

   If you just want to make a local version of ProTcXl, e.g. to try
   out a new release or new Tcl/Tk, type 'make local'.
   This will leave the ProTcXl files in the current directory
   and you can load the interface into Prolog here by calling
	:- use_module(tk).
6) If it is not possible to load the interface dynamically
   (currently on Linux, AIX4.1, HP and m88k), or if it is too slow
   (all systems that don't use shared libraries), you can link it
   statically into the ECLiPSe binary. In this case, first install
   ProTcXl with 'make install', change the INST_PARAMS file in
   $ECLIPSEDIR/boot/$ARCH to have
       WANT_STATIC_TCL=yes
   and (re-)install ECLiPSe.

FILES
-----

ProTcXl is using the following files:

ProTcXl source:		ECLIPSEDIR/protcl/protcl2.*/{protcl,tk,xlib,tkAppInit}.c
ECliPSe include file:	ECLIPSEDIR/include/external.h
Tcl include files:	TCL_INCLUDE/tcl.h
Tcl library:		TCL_LIBRARY/libtcl7.4.a
Tk include files:	TK_INCLUDE/tk.h
Tk library:		TK_LIBRARY/libtk4.0.a
X library		libX11.a (with -L in XLIBSW)

The ProTcXl documentation is in http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/html/protcl.html
and in ftp://ftp.ecrc.de/pub/eclipse/doc, but it has not been updated to 2.0 yet.
The new docs will contain a short introduction to using Tcl/Tk as well
as a manual for Tcl/Tk and Xlib interface to ECLiPSe. Until it is ready,
please use ProTcXl exactly as ProTcl 1.4.
Send bug and problem reports to micha@ecrc.de.
To improve the docs, I would be gratefull for any problems with using ProTcXl
and its documentation.

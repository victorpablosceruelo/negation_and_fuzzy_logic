    * tcl is not a prefix anymore.
    * tcl.pl almost completely rewritten.
    * Prolog cannot be called from tcl -- some SICStus hooks
    simulated, but not implemented.
    * tcl_next_event returns only one atom or number. The foreign
    interface for 0.7 does not construct lists (yet...). If a list of
    args is passed to Tcl prolog_event, the whole list is translated
    to an atom.
    * tk_do_one_event_atom: returns an atom instead of a list.
    * tk_do_one_event_atom_list: returns a list of atoms,
    corresponding to the Tcl list. 
    * tk_do_one_event: returns a (nested) list whose elemental
    components are strings.

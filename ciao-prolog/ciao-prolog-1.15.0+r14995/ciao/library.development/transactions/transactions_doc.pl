:- doc(summary," Prolog traditionally implements database-like
functionality by using the builtin dynamic database.  The dynamic database
is more powerful than a traditional relational database.  This is because
the dynamic database stores predicates, which are an abstraction for
relations.  Predicates provide a finite representation for a (potentially)
infinite set of relations.

Dynamic predicates are good, however such an boost in expressive power is
not typically needed for doing database-like storage/retrieval from typical
programs.  The implementors of Ciao offer a nice tradeoff called data
facts.  Data facts ensure a finite set of relations, whereas retrieval of
data facts is still declarative (i.e.  backtracking is still for free).

Thus the use of data facts enables relational database functionality in all
its glory.  Moreover, it is useful to consider/realize that a data
predicate is the conceptual equivalent of a table in a relational database.

Another important distinction between so-called \"traditional\" database
systems (MySQL, Oracle, etc...) and Ciao data_facts is that the former are
typically run as a system \"service\" or \"server\" whereas database access
in Ciao using data_facts is \"built-in,\" or \"transparent.\" I'd argue
that the Ciao approach is much more elegant and convenient.  However, the
approach does beg the issue how to implement an authoritative datastore
across multiple Ciao program instances.

That said, the scope of this library is to provide transactional semantics
across multiple Ciao threads accessing the same database.  Because of this
scoping, the transaction management is implemented @index{cooperatively}.
This means that all of the transaction enabling calls are expanded inline
into user code so that the proper cooperation occurs without the
introduction of extra threads.  This approach means that it was limited in
by the techniques available for handling certain aspects (e.g. deadlock
detection using timeouts) that can only be implemented preemptively from an
external thread.  For a more detailed discussion of how this work may be
extended to a \"service\"-like implementation see the \"Bugs and Planned
Improvements\" section in this module.

The need for transactions arise in multi-user/concurrent systems.  When
there is more than one subject accessing the database there is potential
for confusion, and even worse, inacurracy. The notion of transaction
addresses these potential problems.  A transaction is a grouping of
operations that is meant to be executed under ACID (Atomicity, Consistency,
Isolation, and Durability) properties - see @cite{ElmasriNavathe00}.

In SQL, a transaction is specified something like

@begin{verbatim}
BEGIN TRANSACTION

...

COMMIT
@end{verbatim}

Such a declaration results in 1) the database system enforces
@index{atomicity} - if anything goes wrong before the commit point the
transaction will be aborted and all side effects will be rolled back and 2)
the database system enforces @index{isolation} - all read/write on the
database for the duration of the transaction will appear to have occurred
sequentially.

This module enables one to denote a predicate as transactional.  This is
done using the transactional declaration.  For example

@begin{verbatim}

:- transactional(deposit/2)

@end{verbatim}

will expand the definition of @code{deposit/2} to 1)
be executed in the context of a transaction id (so
that the system can execute @index{atomic} commit/abort properly)
and 2) obtain the correct read/write locks upon acess
to data facts in order to enforce @index{isolation}.").

:- doc(module,"@section{Atomicity}

In order for an executing transaction to be atomic, when it is done executing
either 1) it is commited indicating that the entire transaction ran or 2)
it is rolled-back indicating that somewhere during the execution something went
wrong and database modifications were undone.

This package implements atomicity by keeping a \"journal.\" Often referred
to as the DBMS Journal, this record contains a transcript of all
modifications to the database.  Since this module implements transactions
cooperatively, calls to writers (assert_fact, retract_fact, etc...) are
expanded to not only perform the intended operation but also assert a
record of the operation in a data_fact called dbmsj.

With the existence of the dbmsj, the rollback procedure needed when a
transaction aborts is as simple as backtracking over all operations in the
transaction and executing inverse operations.  Note that, in light of this
approach, it is non-trivial (well, impossible without forcing the low-level
to cough up a transcript of all the facts that were retracted) to rollback
a retractall_fact operation.  Thus retractall_fact operations are not
supported here.  @p @section{Isolation}

Transactions are expanded such that locks are obtained according to the
rules of strict two-phase locking.  Strict two-phase locking mandates that
a transaction does not release any lock that it owns until the transaction
either aborts or commits.  Such a scheme guarantees a serializable schedule
of operations.  This package implements shared/exclusive read/write locks
as a low-level locking mechanism @cite{ElmasriNavathe00}.").

% The standard LIPS benchmark
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

:- doc(lips(System),"This benchmark gives the raw @index{speed of
   a Prolog system}.

   The measure of @index{logical inferences per second}
   (@concept{LIPS}) used here is taken to be procedure calls per
   second over an example with not very complex procedure calls. The
   example used is that of ``naive reversing'' a list, which is an
   expensive, and therefore stupid, way of reversing a list.  It does,
   however, produce a lot of procedure calls. (In theoretical terms,
   this algorithm is O(n^2) on the length of the list).

   The use of a single simple benchmark like this cannot, of course,
   be taken to signify a great deal. However, experience has shown
   that this benchmark does provide a good measure of basic Prolog
   speed and produces figures which match more complex benchmarks. The
   reason for this is that the basic operations performed here:
   procedure calls with a certain amount of data structure access and
   construction; are absolutely fundamental to Prolog execution. If
   these are done right, then more complex benchmarks tend to scale
   accordingly. This particular benchmark has thus been used as a good
   rule of thumb by Prolog implementors for over a decade and forms a
   part of the unwritten Prolog folklore. So - use this benchmark,
   with this in mind, as a quick, but useful, test of Prolog
   performance.

   In a complete evaluation of a Prolog system you should also be taking
   account speeds of asserting and compiling, tail recursion, memory
   utilisation, compactness of programs, storage management and garbage
   collection, debugging and editing facilities, program checking and help
   facilities, system provided predicates, interfaces to external
   capabilities, documentation and support, amongst other factors.").

   for running @index{Prolog benchmarks}. The benchmark itself is run
   by calling predicate @var{Bench}, which should be a predicate of
   arity zero. @pred{bench/5} will use the exported predicate
   @pred{repeat/1} to iterate the right number of times, taking care
   of factoring out the overhead of setting the test up and of using
   @pred{repeat/1} to iterate. This is done by running dummy code to
   see how much time the extra operations take. This dummy code should
   be contained in a predicate called @var{Bench}@tt{_dummy}, which
   should also be of arity one, and which should contain all the setup
   operations that are not to be measured so that @pred{bench/5} can
   factor them out.  For large enough values of @var{Count},
   @var{TimePerIteration} should typically be constant.  See
   @pred{lots/3} for a (very simple) method for determining the right
   value for @var{Count}. @var{TimePerIteration} is the net time taken
   by each iteration running the benchmark (excluding the time taken
   by the setup and benchmarking overhead)

A Few Examples/Tests of Ciao features
-------------------------------------

This directory contains a few very basic examples.  More examples of
the different Ciao features are included in the different libraries
(located under the directories lib and library of the distribution).
You are strongly encouraged to explore the manual and those
directories and try out those examples.

The Makefile in this directory is not provided for the purpose of
compiling/executing the examples in it, but for installation purposes.
It is not useful outside the Ciao Prolog sources.

Parallel execution allows for several execution threads to be executed
simultaneously. Thus, there might be several concurrent executions at
a given time. However, execution might or might be not trully
concurrent, depending on the available processors. Also, and-parallel
execution requires that such threads be independent w.r.t.\ their
bindings, and executes only parallel fork-and-join constructions:
the solutions of parallel goals are synchronized right after they
finish. 

Concurrent programming superseeds the restrictions of the
and-parallel execution in several ways. It allows mapping execution
threads to real threads of the processor. It also allows for
programming the concurrent execution of any number of threads,
independent or not. And it also leaves synchronization of those
threads in the hands of the programmer. It is more flexible, but also
more complex.

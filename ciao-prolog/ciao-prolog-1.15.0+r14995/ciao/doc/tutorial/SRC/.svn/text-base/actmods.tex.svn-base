\section{Active Modules, Active Objects, and Agent Programming}

The concept of a module being active provides a uniform view of
modularity, OOP, and distributed programming. A module is
{\em active} if it can run as a separate process, thus independently
of the rest of the program, and possibly distributed. Classes can also
be made active. Objects, too. This opens up the possibility of
programming agents.

\subsection{Independent File Names}

In .ciaorc

\begin{verbatim}
file(1,'/home/user/...').
...
file(n,...
\end{verbatim}

In the program:

\begin{verbatim}
... :- ..., file(3,File3), open(File3,...
\end{verbatim}

This makes tan executable completely portable: you only have to change
the .ciaorc between different runs if you want different files or if
you are using different file systems with different file naming
conventions.

Modules provide for code encapsulation. Classes in Object Oriented
Programming (OOP) extend modules in that they are associated to a data
structure. A class can be viewed as a pair of a module and a data
type. Its module part provides the operations allowed on the data. Its
type part provides the state of the data itself. Adding instantiation,
one can have several encapsulated data items of the type. This is
essential in Abstract Data Types (ADTs).

O'Ciao incorporates OOP into Prolog via a simple and natural extension
of modules along the lines mentioned above.

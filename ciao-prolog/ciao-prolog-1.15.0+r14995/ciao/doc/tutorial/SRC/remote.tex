\section{Distributed Programming}

Besides running several processes concurrently in different execution
threads in a machine, there is also the possibility of running
processes in different machines. This opens up the field of
distributed programming. 

In Ciao, distributed and concurrent programming are completely
separated. You can run concurrently but locally, or distributedly but
sequentially, or distributedly and concurrently. The previous section
explained concurrency, this one explains distribution. Bear in mind
that they are different things.

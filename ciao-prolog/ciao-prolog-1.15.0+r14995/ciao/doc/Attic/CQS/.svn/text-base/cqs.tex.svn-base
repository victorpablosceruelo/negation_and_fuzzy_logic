\item Module names should be specific enough. Do not use names as
  'main', 'utilities', 'c'.  Files intended to be included can have more
  general names, as for example 'ops.pl' the source where oprerators for
  a package are defined.
    Rationale:  Module names are global in an entire application.  Too general
  names in libraries may clash with user-defined module names.
\item Name of multifile predicates should be specific enough. Do not use
  names as 'p', 'info', 'relation'.  If the multifile predicate is not
  to be defined in user code, use names with a \texttt{\$}.
    Rationale:  Names of multifile predicates are global in an entire
  application.  Too general names in libraries may clash with
  names of multifile predicates defined by the user or in other libraries.

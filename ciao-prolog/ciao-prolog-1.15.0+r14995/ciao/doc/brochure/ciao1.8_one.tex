Ciao is a complete Prolog system, supporting \emph{ISO-Prolog}, but
its novel modular design allows both \emph{restricting} and
\emph{extending} the language. This makes it possible to work with
\emph{fully declarative subsets} of Prolog and also to \emph{extend}
these subsets (or ISO-Prolog) both syntactically and semantically.
Most importantly, these restrictions and extensions can be activated
separately on each program module so that several extensions can 
coexist in the same application for different modules.

Ciao currently includes extensions for feature terms (records),
functional logic programming, higher-order (with predicate
abstractions), constraints, object-oriented programming, persistence,
several control rules (breadth-first search, iterative deepening,
...), concurrency (threads/engines), distributed execution (agents),
concurrent built-in database, and parallel execution.  Libraries also
support WWW programming, sockets, external interfaces (C, Java, TclTk,
relational databases, etc.), etc.

\emph{Programming in the large} is supported thanks to the robust
module/class system, module-based automatic incremental compilation
(with no need for makefiles), an assertion language for declaring
(\emph{optional}) program properties (including types, modes,
determinacy, non-failure, cost, ...), automatic static inference and
static/dynamic checking of such assertions, program optimization and
parallelization, and powerful automatic documentation generation (the
latter tasks performed by the \emph{CiaoPP preprocessor} and the
\emph{LPdoc autodocumenter}).  It is the novel modular design of Ciao
which enables modular program development, effective global program
analysis, and static debugging and optimization via source to source
program transformation.

\emph{Programming in the small} is supported by having reduced size
executables, which only include those builtins and libraries used by
the program, and by supporting
% \emph{scripts} written in Prolog.
Prolog \emph{scripts}.

The compiler generates several forms of architecture-independent and
stand-alone executables. Program modules can be compiled into compact
bytecode and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded. The
executables generated are very competitive in both performance and
size with all current commercial and academic Prolog systems.

The programming environment also offers a rich \texttt{emacs}
interface (with direct access to top-level/debugger, preprocessor,
and autodocumenter), embeddable source-level debugger with
breakpoints, and some execution visualization tools.

---- Downloading Beta Versions of the Ciao Prolog Development System ----

Thank you for you interest in the Ciao Prolog Development System. The
current Beta version of the Ciao system (Linux, Solaris, SunOS, IRIX,
Windows95/98/NT, ...) as well as compatible versions of the
auto-documenter and the preprocessor (experimental) and are now
available for download from:

http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Beta/Ciao

The area under http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Beta/ requires a
user name and password to enter (the reason is not protection --this
software is distributed under GNU General Public License-- but rather
that some of this software is still under development, mostly with
regard to the documentation), as follows:

user:      clipsoft 
password:  clipfriends 

We will very much appreciate if you let us know of any problem that
you may have during installation or use of these or other CLIP
packages, which we will try to fix for upcoming releases. Please send
email to

ciao-bug@clip.dia.fi.upm.es

Also, if you make any improvements to the system, we would be very
grateful if you can send them to us so that we can incorporate them
into the next distribution if appropriate.

Also note that the standard distributions are under:

http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Ciao

(no password needed).

Finally, we would be very grateful if you reference the Ciao System in
any work that you might develop with its help.

Happy logic programming!

The CLIP Ciao Prolog Development Team

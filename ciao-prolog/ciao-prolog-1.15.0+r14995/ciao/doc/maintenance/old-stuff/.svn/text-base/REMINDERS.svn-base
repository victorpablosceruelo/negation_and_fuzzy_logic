- We should not post any version without testing it. In order to test
  a distribution, we typically post it in the alpha or beta
  sites. The procedure of posting a version itself can be tested by
  posting in Test. These are at: 

  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Test/  
  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Alpha/  
  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Beta/  

  (the Local user and password work)

  To generate a distribution there select (by uncommenting) the
  appropriate option in the SETTINGS file in the Ciao dist directory:

  # DISTTYPE=
  # DISTTYPE=Beta/
  # DISTTYPE=Alpha/
  # DISTTYPE=Test/

- The main thing that we should make sure of when posting publicly
  (outside Beta or Alpha) a version is that it installs properly in
  all platforms, including the manuals, etc.. Also, we should make
  sure that there is no weird stuff (libraries that normally work but
  that have been left in an intermediary state and don't work, files
  with comments in Spanish, directories with libraries that don't work
  at all, etc., etc.).

  Even then, we first post the version marked as "for testing" and
  hope that a few brave souls will find the remaining bugs that we
  cannot test here.

- For producing a proper new version we should in addition at least
  worry about the following:

  - That everything really works. This typically requires completely
    freezing the development version for some days in which we try
    everything that we can think of in all platforms.
    It is also necessary to try out all the examples in all the libraries.
  - That we have the even version (1.8, 2.0, 2.2, ...) comment in 
    /home/clip/Systems/ciao/doc/common/ciao.pl
    properly updated in a user-frienly manner, summing up all the changes.
  - That we do not have libraries that do not work.
  - That libraries which are half cooked are marked as such if they
    are included (e.g., the new active module/remote stuff, the
    &-Prolog stuff, ...).
  - We need to have a new announcement message and a new brochure.
  - Also, a new version is typically motivated by at least one
    major new feature (although many small ones can also do the trick,
    I guess).

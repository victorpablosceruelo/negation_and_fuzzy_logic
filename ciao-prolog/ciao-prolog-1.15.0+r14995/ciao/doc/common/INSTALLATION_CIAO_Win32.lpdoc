@cindex{installation, Windows, from binaries}

This describes the installation of Ciao after downloading the Windows
@em{binary} (i.e., @em{precompiled}) distribution.  It includes the
installation of libraries and manuals and applies to Windows
95/98/NT/2000/XP systems. This is the simplest Windows installation,
since it requires no compilation and is highly recommended. However,
it is also possible to compile Ciao from the source distribution on
these systems (please refer to @ref{Installing Ciao from the source
distribution} for details).

If you find any problems during installation, please refer to
@ref{Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)}.
@cindex{troubleshooting} See also @ref{Downloading new versions} and
@ref{Reporting bugs}.

@section{Win32 binary installation summary}

@noindent Please follow these steps (below we use the terms
@em{folder} and @em{directory} interchangeably):

@begin{enumerate} 

@item Download the precompiled distribution and unpack it into any
      suitable folder, such as, e.g., @tt{C:\Program Files}.

      This will create there a folder whose name reflects the Ciao
      version. Due to limitations of Windows related to file
      associations, do not put Ciao too deep in the folder hierarchy.
      For unpacking you will need a recent version of a zip archive
      manager -- there are many freely available such as @apl{WinZip},
      @apl{unzip}, @apl{pkunzip}, etc. (see for example
      @tt{www.winzip.com}). Some users have reported some problems
      with version 6.2 of WinZip, but no problems with, e.g., version
      7. With WinZip, simply click on ``Extract'' and select the
      extraction folder as indicated above.

@item Stop any Ciao-related  applications.

      If you have a previous version of Ciao installed, make sure you
      do not have any Ciao applications (including, e.g., a toplevel
      shell) running, or the extraction process may not be able to
      complete. You may also want to delete the entire folder of the
      previous installation to save space.

@item Open the Ciao source directory created during extraction and run
      (e.g. by double-clicking on it) the @tt{install}(@tt{.bat})
      script. Answer ``yes'' to the dialog that pops up and type any
      character in the installation window to finish the process. You
      may need to reboot for the changes in the registry to take
      effect.

      This will update the windows registry (the file @tt{ciao}(@tt{.reg})
      lists the additions) and also create some @tt{.bat} files which
      may be useful for running Ciao executables from the command
      line.  It also creates initialization scripts for the
      @apl{emacs} editor. The actions performed by the installation
      script are reported in the installation window.

@item You may want to add a @index{windows shortcut} @cindex{shortcut,
      windows} in a convenient place, such as the desktop, to
      @apl{ciaosh.cpx}, the standard interactive toplevel shell. It is
      located inside the @tt{shell} folder (e.g., click on the file
      @apl{ciaosh.cpx} with the right mouse button and select the
      appropriate option, @tt{Send to->Desktop as shortcut}).

@item You may also want to add another shortcut to the file
      @file{ciao}(@tt{.html}) located inside
      @tt{doc\reference\ciao_html} so that you can open the
      Ciao manual by simply double-clicking on this shortcut. 

@item Finally, if the (freely available) @apl{emacs}
      editor/environment is not installed in your system, we
      @em{highly recommend} that you also install it at this point.
      While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, the
      Ciao distribution includes a very powerful @cindex{development
      environment} @em{application development environment} which is
      based on @apl{emacs} and which enables, e.g., source-level
      debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive on-line help,
      etc. If you are not convinced, consider that many programmers 
      inside Micros*ft use @tt{emacs} for developing their programs.

@include{EmacsDownload.lpdoc}

      @cindex{emacs mode, setting up, Win32} You need to tell
      @apl{emacs} how to load the Ciao mode automatically when editing
      and how to access the on-line documentation: 

      @begin{itemize}

      @item Start @apl{emacs} (double click on the icon or from the
            @tt{Start} menu). Open (menu @tt{Files->Open File} or
            simply @key{^X}@key{^F}) the file @file{ForEmacs.txt} that
            the installation script has created in directory where you
            installed the Ciao distribution.

      @item Copy the lines in the file (select with the mouse and then
            menu @tt{Edit->Copy}). Open/Create using @apl{emacs} (menu
            @tt{Files->Open File} or simply @key{^X}@key{^F}) the file
            @file{~/.emacs} (or, if this fails, @file{c:/.emacs}).

      @item Paste the two lines (menu @tt{Edit->Paste} or simply
            @key{^Y}) into the file and save (menu @tt{Files->Save
            Buffer} or simply @key{^X}@key{^S}).

      @item Exit @apl{emacs} and start it again.

      @end{itemize}

      @noindent @apl{emacs} should not report any errors (at least
      related to Ciao) on startup. At this point the @apl{emacs}
      checks in the following section should work.

@end{enumerate}

@section{Checking for correct installation on Win32}

After the actions and registry changes performed by the installation
procedure, you should check that the following should work correctly:

@include{InstallTestWin32bin.lpdoc}

@noindent
Finally, if @apl{emacs} is installed, after starting it
(double-clicking on the @tt{emacs} icon or from the @tt{Start} menu)
the following should work:

@include{EmacsTesting.lpdoc}

If you find that everything works but @tt{emacs} cannot start the Ciao
toplevel you may want to check if you can open a normal Windows shell
within @tt{emacs} (just do @key{M-x} @tt{shell}). If you cannot, it is
possible that you are using some anti-virus software which is causing
problems. See
@href{http://www.gnu.org/software/emac/windows/faq3.html#anti-virus}
for a workaround.

In some Windows versions it is possible that you had to change the
@em{first} backslashes in the ciao-mode-init.el file in the Ciao
Directory.  E.g., assuming you have installed in drive @tt{c:},
instances of @tt{c:\} need to be changed to @tt{c:/}.  For example:
@tt{c:\prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat} should be changed to
@tt{c:/prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat}.


@section{Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows}

The @file{etc} folder contains a number of utilities, documented in
the manual in @em{PART V - Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities}.  In
the Win32 distribution these utilities are not compiled by the
installation process.  You can create the executable for each of them
when needed by compiling the corresponding @tt{.pl} file.

@section{Server installation under Windows}

@cindex{installation, Windows clients}
@cindex{installation, Windows server}

If you would like to install Ciao on a server machine, used by several
clients, the following steps are recommended:

@begin{itemize}

@item Follow the standard installation procedure on the server. When
      selecting the folder in which Ciao is installed make sure you
      select a folder that is visible by the client machines. Also
      make sure that the functionality specified in the previous
      sections is now available on the server.

@item Perform a @index{client installation} on each client, by running
      (e.g., double-click on it) the @file{client.bat} script. This
      should update the registry of each client. At this point all the
      functionality should also be available on the clients.

@end{itemize}

@section{CGI execution under IIS}

The standard installation procedure updates the windows registry so
that Ciao executables (ending in @tt{.cpx}) are directly executable as
CGIs under Microsoft's IIS, i.e., so that you make applications
written in Ciao available on the WWW (see the @lib{pillow} library for
specific support for this task).  In the event you re-install IIS, you
probably would lose the entries in the registry which allow this.  In
that case, processing the file @file{ciao.reg} produced during the
installation (or simply reinstalling Ciao) will add those entries
again.

@section{Uninstallation under Windows}

@comment{*** Should have an uninstall script also...}

To uninstall Ciao under Windows, simply delete the directory in which
you put the Ciao distribution.  If you also want to delete the
registry entries created by the Ciao installation (not strictly
needed) this must currently be done by hand.  The installation leaves
a list of these entries in the file @file{ciao.reg} to aid in this
task. Also, all the register entries contain the word @em{ciao}.
Thus, to delete all Ciao entries, run the application @apl{regedit}
(for example, by selecting @tt{Run} from the Windows @tt{Start} menu),
search (@key{^F}) for @em{ciao} in all registry entries (i.e., select
all of @tt{Keys}, @tt{Values}, and @tt{Data} in the @tt{Edit->Find}
dialog), and delete each matching key (click on the left window to
find the matching key for each entry found).

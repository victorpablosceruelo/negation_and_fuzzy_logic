@begin{itemize} 

@item Ciao-related file types (@tt{.pl} source files, @tt{.cpx}
      executables, @tt{.itf,.po,.asr} interface files, @tt{.pls}
      scripts, etc.) should have specific icons associated with them
      (you can look at the files in the folders in the Ciao
      distribution to check).

@item Double-clicking on the shortcut to @apl{ciaosh}(@tt{.cpx}) on
      the desktop should start the typical Prolog-style top-level
      shell in a window. If this shortcut has not been created on the
      desktop, then double-clicking on the @apl{ciaosh}(@tt{.cpx})
      icon inside the @tt{shell} folder within the Ciao source folder
      should have the same effect.

@item In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
      correctly. Type for example @tt{use_module(library(dec10_io)).}
      at the Ciao top-level prompt --you should get back a prompt with
      no errors reported.

@item To exit the top level shell, type @tt{halt.} as usual, or
      @key{^D}.

@end{itemize}

@noindent
Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

@begin{itemize} 

@item Double-clicking on the shortcut to @tt{ciao}(@tt{.html}) which appears
      on the desktop should show the Ciao manual in your default WWW
      browser.  If this shortcut has not been created you can
      double-click on the @tt{ciao}(@tt{.html}) file in the
      @tt{doc\reference\ciao_html} folder inside the Ciao source
      folder. Make sure you configure your browser to use @index{style
      sheets} for correct formatting of the manual (note, however,
      that some older versions of @concept{Explorer} did not support
      style sheets well and will give better results turning them
      off).

      @cindex{printing, manual} 
      @cindex{manual, printing}
      @cindex{help}

@item The @tt{doc\reference} folder contains the manual also in the
      other formats present in the distribution, such as @tt{info}
      (very convenient for users of the @apl{emacs} editor/program
      development system) and @tt{postscript} or @tt{pdf}, which are
      specially useful for printing. See @ref{Printing manuals
      (Win32)} for instructions.

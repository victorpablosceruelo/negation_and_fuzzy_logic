This describes the installation procedure for the Ciao system,
including libraries and manuals, from a @em{source} distribution.
This applies primarily to Unix-type systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,
SunOS, etc.).  However, the sources can also be compiled if so desired
on Windows systems -- see @ref{Installation and compilation under
Windows} for details.

If you find any problems during installation, please refer to
@ref{Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)}.
@cindex{troubleshooting} See also @ref{Downloading new versions} and
@ref{Reporting bugs}.

@section{Un*x installation summary}
@cindex{installation, Un*x, summary}
@cindex{installation, Mac OS X, summary}

@noindent @bf{Note}: It is recommended that you read the full
installation instructions (specially if the installation will be
shared by different architectures). However, in many cases it suffices
to follow this summary:

@begin{enumerate}

@item Uncompress and unpackage (using @apl{gunzip} and @tt{tar -xpf})
      the distribution. This will put everything in a new directory
      whose name reflects the Ciao version.

@item Type @tt{./ciaosetup configure}.  This will autodetect and
      configure the system for your specific platform.  If you need
      more control about what configure does, just add the option
      @tt{--help} to see more arguments.

      The option @tt{--menu} show a menu with configurable options.
      You must follow the instructions that appears on it.

      Note that the @concept{GNU} implementation of the @concept{make}
      Un*x command is used internally in some specific parts. It is
      available in many systems (including all Linux systems and Mac
      OS X) simply as @apl{make}. If this or next steps stop right
      away with @apl{make} error messages it is probably an older
      version and you need to install @tt{gmake}.

@item Type @tt{./ciaosetup build}. This will build executables and
      compile libraries.

@item Type @tt{./ciaosetup install}. This will install everything in
      the specified directories.

@item The system will do the right modifications in your startup
      scripts. This will make the documentation accessible, set the
      correct mode when opening Ciao source files in @apl{emacs}, etc.
      The modified files are tagged with the names \'DOTBASHRC\',
      \'DOTCSHRC\' and \'DOTEMACS\', which are the startup files for
      bash, csh and emacs respectively.

      The following modifications are done automatically in your
      startup scripts, and you don't need to do it manually. This will
      make the documentation accessible, set the correct mode when
      opening Ciao source files in @apl{emacs}, etc. Note that
      @tt{<v>libroot</v>} must be replaced with the appropriate value:
      @cindex{environment variable definitions}

      @include{UserSetup.lpdoc}

      If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine,
      make sure that you instruct all users to do the same.  If you
      are the system administrator, the previous steps can be done
      once and for all, and globally for all users by including the
      lines above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux
      @file{/etc/bashrc}, @file{/etc/csh.login},
      @file{/etc/csh.cshrc}, @file{/etc/skel},
      @file{/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl}, etc.).

@item Finally, if the (freely available) @apl{emacs}
      editor/environment is not installed in your system, we
      @em{highly recommend} that you also install it at this point
      (see @ref{Un*x full installation instructions} for
      instructions).  While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of
      your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very powerful
      @cindex{development environment} @em{application development
      environment} which is based on @apl{emacs} and which enables,
      e.g., source-level debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive
      on-line help, etc.

@item You may want now want to check your installation (see
      @ref{Checking for correct installation on Un*x}) and read the
      documentation, which is stored in @tt{DOCDIR} (copied from
      @tt{CIAOSRC/doc/reference}) and can be easily accessed as explained
      in that same section. There are special ``getting started''
      sections at the beginning of the manual.

@item If you have any problems you may want to check the rest of the
      instructions. The system can be @em{uninstalled} by typing
      @tt{./ciaosetup uninstall}.  @cindex{uninstalling}

@end{enumerate}


@section{Un*x full installation instructions}
@cindex{installation, Un*x, full instructions}
@cindex{installation, Mac OS X, full instructions}

@begin{enumerate}

@item @bf{Uncompress and unpackage:} (using @apl{gunzip} and @tt{tar
      -xpf}) @cindex{tar} the distribution in a suitable
      directory. This will create a new directory called
      @tt{ciao-X.Y}, where @tt{X.Y} is the version number of the
      distribution.  The @tt{-p} option in the @apl{tar} command
      ensures that the relative dates of the files in the package are
      preserved, which is needed for correct operation of the
      Makefiles.

@item @bf{Select installation options:} Run the @tt{./ciaosetup
      configure} command and answer the questions that appears in the
      menu.  The meaning of some important options in the menu is as
      follows:

 @begin{itemize}

%        @item @tt{CIAOSRC}: directory where the sources are
%        stored. @cindex{source directory}

       @item @tt{BINDIR}: directory where the Ciao executables will
       go.  For example, if @tt{BINDIR=/usr/local/bin}, then the Ciao
       @concept{compiler} (@apl{ciaoc}) will be stored at
       @tt{/usr/local/bin/ciaoc}. Actually, it will be a link to
       @tt{ciaoc-}@em{VersionNumber}. This applies also to other
       executables below and is done so that several versions of Ciao
       can coexist on the same machine.  Note that the @em{version
       installed latest} will be the one started by default when
       typing @tt{ciao}, @tt{ciaoc}, etc.  @cindex{binary directory}

       @item @tt{LIBROOT}: directory where the @concept{run-time
       libraries} will be installed.  @cindex{library directory} The
       Ciao installation procedure will create a new subdirectory
       @tt{ciao} below @tt{LIBROOT} and a subdirectory below this one
       for each Ciao version installed.  For example, if
       @tt{LIBROOT=/usr/local/lib} and you have Ciao version @tt{x.y},
       then the libraries will be installed under
       @tt{/usr/local/lib/ciao/ciao-x.y}. This allows you to install
       @concept{site-specific programs} under @tt{/usr/local/lib/ciao}
       and they will not be overwritten if a new version of Ciao is
       installed. It also again allows having several Ciao versions
       installed simultaneously.

       @item @tt{DOCDIR}: directory where the @concept{manuals} will
       be installed. It is often convenient if this directory is
       accessible via @concept{WWW}
       (@tt{DOCDIR=/home/httpd/html/ciao}, or something like that).

@end{itemize}

    For network-based installations, @cindex{installation, network
    based} it is of @em{utmost importance} that the configured paths
    be reachable in all the networked machines.  Different machines
    with different architectures can share the same physical source
    directory during installation, since compilations for different
    architectures take place in dedicated subdirectories. Also,
    different machines/architectures can share the same @tt{LIBROOT}
    directory (@tt{LIBROOT} is configured in the menu). This saves
    space since the architecture-independent libraries will be
    shared. See @ref{Multiarchitecture support} below.

@item @bf{Compile Ciao:} At the ciao top level
      directory type @tt{./ciaosetup build}.

      This will:

      @begin{itemize}

      @item Build an @concept{engine} in @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/bin/$(CIAOARCH)},
            where @tt{$(CIAOARCH)} depends on the architecture.  The
            engine is the actual interpreter of the low level code
            into which Ciao programs are compiled.

      @item Build a new Ciao @concept{standalone compiler}
            (@apl{ciaoc}), with the default paths set for your local
            configuration (nonetheless, these can be overridden by
            environment variables, as described below).

      @item Precompile all the libraries under @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/lib} and
            @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/library} using this compiler.

      @item Compile a toplevel @concept{Ciao shell} and a shell for
            @concept{Ciao scripts}, @cindex{scripts} under the
            @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/shell} directory.

      @item Compile some small, auxiliary applications (contained in
            the @file{etc} directory, and documented in the part of
            the manual on 'Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities').

      @end{itemize}

      This step can be repeated successively for several architectures
      in the same source directory. Only the engine and some small
      parts of the libraries (those written in @concept{C}) differ
      from one architecture to the other.  Standard Ciao code
      compiles into @concept{bytecode object files} (@tt{.po}) and/or
      @concept{executables} which are portable among machines of
      different architecture, provided there is an executable engine
      accessible in every such machine. See more details below under
      @ref{Multiarchitecture support}.


@item @bf{Check compilation:} If the above steps have been
      satisfactorily finished, the compiler has compiled itself and
      all the distribution modules, and very probably everything is
      fine.

@item @bf{Install Ciao:} To install Ciao in the directories selected
      in the configuration script during step 2 above, type
      @tt{./ciaosetup install}. This will:

      @begin{itemize}

      @item Install the executables of the Ciao @concept{program
            development tools} (i.e., the general driver/top-level
            @apl{ciao}, the standalone compiler @apl{ciaoc}, the
            script interpreter @apl{ciao-shell}, miscellaneous
            utilities, etc.) in @tt{BINDIR} (see below). In order to
            use these tools, the @tt{PATH} @cindex{PATH}
            @concept{environment variable} of users needs to contain
            the path @tt{BINDIR}.

      @item Install the Ciao libraries under @tt{LIBROOT/ciao} (these
            will be automatically found).

      @item Install under @tt{DOCDIR} the Ciao manuals in several
            formats (such as GNU @tt{info}, @tt{html},
            @tt{postscript}, etc.), depending on the distribution. In
            order for these manuals to be found when typing @tt{M-x
            info} within @apl{emacs}, or by the standalone @apl{info}
            and @apl{man} commands, the @tt{MANPATH} @cindex{MANPATH}
            and @tt{INFOPATH} @cindex{INFOPATH} @concept{environment
            variables} of users both need to contain the path
            @tt{DOCDIR}.

      @item Install under @tt{LIBROOT/ciao} the Ciao GNU @apl{emacs}
            interface (@file{ciao.el}, which provides an interactive
            interface to the Ciao program development tools, as well
            as some other auxiliary files) and a file
            @file{ciao-mode-init} containing the @apl{emacs}
            initialization commands which are needed in order to use
            the Ciao @apl{emacs} interface.

      @end{itemize}

@item @bf{Set up user environments:} In order to automate the process
      of setting the variables above, the installation process leaves
      the files @tt{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc} (for @apl{csh}-like
      shells), @tt{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTprofile} (for @apl{sh}-like
      shells), and @tt{LIBROOT/ciao/ciao-mode-init} (for emacs) with
      appropriate definitions which will take care of all needed
      @concept{environment variable definitions} and @concept{emacs
      mode setup}.  If you has indicated in the menu that the startup
      files must be modified, then the install process will do it for
      you, otherwise you can modify by hand these files making the
      following modifications in your startup scripts, so that these
      files are used (@tt{<v>libroot</v>} must be replaced with the
      appropriate value):

      @include{UserSetup.lpdoc}

      If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine,
      make sure that you instruct all users to do the same.  If you
      are the system administrator, the previous steps can be done
      once and for all, and globally for all users by including the
      lines above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux
      @file{/etc/bashrc}, @file{/etc/csh.login},
      @file{/etc/csh.cshrc}, @file{/etc/skel},
      @file{/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl}, etc.).

@item @bf{Download and install Emacs (highly recommended):} If the (freely
      available) @apl{emacs} editor is not installed in your system,
      its installation is @em{highly recommended} (if you are installing in
      a multi-user machine, you may want to do it in a general area so
      that it is available for other users, even if you do not use it
      yourself). While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of
      your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very powerful
      @cindex{development environment} @em{application development
      environment} which is based on @apl{emacs} and which enables,
      e.g., source-level debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive
      on-line help, etc.

      @include{EmacsDownload.lpdoc}

@item @bf{Check installation / read documentation:} You may now want
      to check your installation (see @ref{Checking for correct
      installation on Un*x}) and read the documentation, which is
      stored in @tt{DOCDIR} (copied from @tt{CIAOSRC/doc/reference}) and
      can be easily accessed as explained that same section. There are
      special ``getting started'' sections at the beginning of the
      manual.

@end{enumerate}

If you have any problems you may want to check @ref{Troubleshooting
(nasty messages and nifty workarounds)}.

The system can be @em{uninstalled} by typing @tt{./ciaosetup
uninstall} in the top directory. Configuration should have not changed
since installation, so that the same directories are cleaned (i.e. the
variables in @file{SETTINGS} should have the same value as when the
install was performed).  @cindex{uninstalling}


@section{Checking for correct installation on Un*x}
@cindex{installation, checking the}

If everything has gone well, several applications and tools should be
available to a normal user.  Try the following while logged in as a
@em{normal user} (important in order to check that permissions are set
up correctly):

@include{InstallTestUnix.lpdoc}

Finally, if @apl{emacs} is installed, after starting it (typing
@tt{emacs}) the following should work:

@include{EmacsTesting.lpdoc}

@section{Cleaning up the source directory}

After installation, the source directory can be cleaned up in several
ways:

@begin{itemize}

@item @tt{./ciaosetup uninstall} removes the installation but does
      not touch the source directories.

@item @tt{./ciaosetup totalclean} leaves the distribution is its
      original form, throwing away any intermediate files (as well as
      any unneeded files left behind by the Ciao developers), while
      still allowing recompilation.

@end{itemize}

@section{Multiarchitecture support}

@cindex{multiarchitecture support}

As mentioned before, Ciao applications (including the compiler and the
top level) can run on several machines with different architectures
without any need for recompiling, provided there is one Ciao engine
(compiled for the corresponding architecture) accessible in each
machine. Also, the Ciao libraries (installed in @tt{LIBROOT}, which
contain also the engines) and the actual binaries (installed in
@tt{BINDIR}) can themselves be shared on several machines with
different architectures, saving disk space.

For example, assume that the compiler is installed
as:

@tt{/usr/local/share/bin/ciaoc}

and the libraries are installed under

@tt{/usr/local/share/lib}

Assume also that the @tt{/usr/local/share} directory is mounted on,
say, a number of @concept{Linux} and a number of @concept{Solaris}
boxes.  In order for @tt{ciaoc} to run correctly on both types of
machines, the following is needed:

@begin{enumerate}

@item Make sure you that have done @tt{./ciaosetup install} on one machine
      of each architecture (once for Linux and once for Solaris in our
      example).  This recompiles and installs a new engine and any
      architecture-dependent parts of the libraries for each
      architecture. The engines will have names such as
      @tt{ciaoengine.LINUXi86}, @tt{ciaoengine.SolarisSparc}, and so
      on.

@item In multi-architecture environments it is even more important to
      make sure that users make the modifications to their startup
      scripts using @file{<v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc} etc.  The selection
      of the engine (and architecture-dependent parts of libraries) is
      done in these scripts by setting the environment variable
      @tt{CIAOARCH}, using the @tt{ciao_get_arch} command, which is
      installed automatically when installing Ciao. This will set
      @tt{CIAOARCH} to, say, @tt{LINUXi86}, @tt{SolarisSparc},
      respectively, and @tt{CIAOENGINE} will be set to
      @tt{ciaoengine.}@em{CIAOARCH}.

      However, note that this is not strictly necessary if running on
      only one architecture: if @tt{CIAOARCH} is not set (i.e.,
      undefined), the Ciao executables will look simply for
      @tt{ciaoengine}, which is always a link to the latest engine
      installed in the libraries. But including the initialization
      files provided has the advantage of setting also paths for the
      manuals, etc.

@end{enumerate}

@section{Installation and compilation under Windows}

There are two possibilities in order to install Ciao on Windows
machines:

@begin{itemize}

@item Installing from the Windows @em{precompiled} distribution. This
      is the easiest since it requires no compilation and is highly
      recommended. This is described in @ref{Installing Ciao from a
      Win32 binary distribution}.

@item Installing the standard Ciao (Un*x) system source
      distribution and compiling it under Windows. This is somewhat
      more complex and currently requires the (freely available)
      Cygnus Win32 development libraries --described below.

@end{itemize}

@cindex{installation, Windows, from sources}
@cindex{compiling, Win32} In order to compile Ciao for Win32
environments you need to have the (public domain) @index{Cygnus Win32}
and development libraries installed in your system. Compilation should
be performed preferably under Windows NT-type systems.

@begin{itemize}

@item Thus, the first step, if Cygnus Win32 is not installed in your
      system, is to download it (from, e.g.,
      @href{http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32}) and install it. The
      compilation process also requires that the executables
      @tt{rm.exe}, @tt{sh.exe}, and @tt{uname.exe} from the Cygnus
      distribution be copied under @tt{/bin} prior to starting the
      process (if these executables are not available under @tt{/bin}
      the compilation process will produce a number of errors and
      eventually stop prematurely).

@item Assuming all of the above is installed, type @tt{./ciaosetup allwin32}.
      This will compile both the engine and the Ciao libraries. In
      this process, system libraries that are normally linked
      dynamically under Un*x (i.e., those for which @tt{.so}
      dynamically loadable files are generated) are linked statically
      into the engine (this is done instead of generating @tt{.dll}s
      because of a limitation in the current version of the Cygnus
      Win32 environment). No actual installation is made at this
      point, i.e., this process leaves things in a similar state as if
      you had just downloaded and uncompressed the precompiled
      distribution.  Thus, in order to complete the installation you
      should now:

@item Follow now the instructions in @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32
      binary distribution}.

@end{itemize}

A further note regarding the executables generated by the Ciao
compiler and top-level: the same considerations given in
@ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution} apply regarding
@tt{.bat} files, etc. However, in a system in which Cygnus Win32 is
installed these executables can also be used in a very simple way. In
fact, the executables can be run as in Un*x by simply typing their
name at the @apl{bash} shell command line without any associated
@tt{.bat} files. This only requires that the @apl{bash} shell which
comes with Cygnus Win32 be installed and accessible: simply, make sure
that @file{/bin/sh.exe} exists.

@section{Porting to currently unsupported operating systems and
architectures}

If you would like to port Ciao to a currently unsupported platform,
there are several issues to take into account. The main one is to get
the @em{engine} to compile in that platform, i.e., the C code under
the @tt{engine} directory.  The procedure currently followed by Ciao
to decide the various flags needed to compile is as follows:

@begin{itemize}

@item The shell script @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/etc/ciao_get_arch} is executed;
it returns a string describing the operating system and the processor
architecture (e.g., @tt{LINUXi86}, @tt{SolarisSparc},
@tt{SolarisAlpha}, etc.).  You should make sure it returns a correct
(and meaningful) string for your setup.  This string is used
throughout the compilation to create several architecture-dependant
flags.

@item Include in the file @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/config-sysdep.sh} the
definitions necessary for the platform. That file sets several flags
regarding, for example, whether to use or not threads, which threads
library to use, the optimization flags to use, the compiler, linker,
and it also sets separately the architecture name (@tt{ARCHNAME}
variable) and the operating system (OSNAME).

@item Most times the porting problems happen in the use of locks and
threads.  You can either disable them, or have a look at the files
@tt{$(CIAOSRC)/engine/locks.h} and @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/engine/threads.h}.  If you
know how to implement native (assembler) locks for your architecture,
enable @tt{HAVE_NATIVE_SLOCKS} for your architecture and add the
definitions.  Otherwise, if you have library-based locks, enable them.
The mechanism in @tt{threads.h} is similar.

@end{itemize}

Once a working engine is achieved, it should be possible to continue
with the standard installation procedure, which will try to use a
completely static version of the standalone compiler (@tt{ciaoc.sta}
in the @tt{ciaoc} directory) to compile the interactive top-level
(@apl{ciaosh}) and a new version of the standalone compiler
(@apl{ciaoc}). These in turn should be able to compile the Ciao
libraries. You may also need to look at some libraries (such as, for
example, @lib{sockets}) which contain C code.  If you do succeed in
porting to a platform that is currently unsupported please send any
patches to @email{ciao@@clip.dia.fi.upm.es}, and we will include them
(with due credit, of course) in the next distribution.

@section{Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)}
@cindex{troubleshooting}

The following a list of common installation problems reported by
users:

@begin{itemize}

@item @bf{Problem:} Compilation errors appear when trying a new
      installation/compilation after the previous one was aborted
      (e.g., because of errors).

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:} It is a good idea to clean up
      any leftovers from the previous compilation using
      @tt{./ciaosetup clean_engine} before restarting the installation or
      compilation process.

@item @bf{Problem:}

      During engine compilation, messages such as the following appear:
      @tt{tasks.c:102:PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS undeclared (first
      use of this function)}.

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      Your (Linux?) system does not have (yet) the @concept{Posix
      threads} library installed.  You can upgrade to one which does
      have it, or download the library from

      @href{http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/index.html}

      and install it, or disable the use of threads in Linux: for
      this, edit the @file{SETTINGS} file and specify
      @tt{USE_THREADS=no}, which will avoid linking against thread
      libraries (it will disable the use of thread-related primitives
      as well).  Clean the engine with @tt{./ciaosetup clean_engine}
      and restart compilation.

      If you have any alternative threads library available, you can
      tinker with @tt{engine/threads.h} and the @tt{config-sysdep.sh}
      file in order to get the task managing macros right for your
      system.  Be sure to link the right library.  If you succeed, we
      (@email{ciao@@clip.dia.fi.upm.es}) will be happy of knowing
      about what you have done.


@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{-lpthread: library not found} (or similar)

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      Your (Linux?) system seems to have Posix threads installed, but
      there is no threads library in the system.  In newer releases
      (e.g., @concept{RedHat 5.0}), the Posix threads system calls
      have been included in @tt{glibc.so}, so specifying
      @tt{-lpthread} in @tt{config-sysdep.sh} is not needed;
      remove it.  @tt{./ciaosetup clean_engine} and restart
      installation.

      Alternatively, you may have made a custom installation of Posix
      threads in a non-standard location: be sure to include the flag
      @tt{-L/this/is/where/the/posix/libraries/are} @bf{before}
      @tt{-lpthread}, and to update @tt{/etc/ld.so.conf} (see @tt{man
      ldconfig}).


@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{Segmentation Violation} (when starting the first executable)

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      This has been observed with certain older versions of @apl{gcc}
      which generated erroneous code under full optimization. The best
      solution is to upgrade to a newer version of
      @apl{gcc}. Alternatively, lowering the level of optimization (by
      editing the @file{SETTINGS} file in the main directory of the
      distribution) normally solves the problem, at the cost of
      reduced execution speed.


@item @bf{Problem:}
      @tt{ciaoc: /home/clip/lib/ciao/ciao-X.Y/engine/ciaoengine: not found}

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      @begin{itemize}

      @item The system was not fully installed and the variable
      @tt{CIAOENGINE} was not set.

      @item The system was installed, the variable @tt{CIAOENGINE} is
      set, but it is does not point to a valid ciaoengine.

      @end{itemize}

      See the file @tt{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc} for user settings for
      environment variables.

@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{ERROR: File library(compiler) not found - aborting...}
      (or any other library is not found)

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      @begin{itemize}

      @item The system was not installed and the variable @tt{CIAOLIB}
      was not set.

      @item The system is installed and the variable @tt{CIAOLIB} is wrong.

      @end{itemize}

      See the file @tt{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc} for user settings for
      environment variables.

@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{ERROR: File <some_directory>/<some_file>.itf not found - aborting...}

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      Can appear when compiling @tt{.pl} files.  The file to compile
      (<some_file>.pl) is not in the directory <some_directory>.  You
      gave a wrong file name or you are in the wrong directory.


@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{*ERROR*: /(write_option,1) is not a regular type} (and
      similar ones)

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      This is not a problem, but rather the type checker catching some
      minor inconsistencies which may appear while compiling the
      libraries.  Bug us to remove it, but ignore it for now.

@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{WARNING: Predicate <some_predicate>/<N> undefined in module
      <some_module>}

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      It can appear when the compiler is compiling Ciao library
      modules.  If so, ignore it (we will fix it).  If it appears when
      compiling user programs or modules, you may want to check your
      program for those undefined predicates.

@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{make: Fatal error in reader: SHARED, line 12: Unexpected
      end of line seen}

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      You are using standard Un*x make, not GNU's make implementation
      (gmake).


@item @bf{Problem:}

      @tt{WARNING}s or @tt{ERROR}s while compiling the Ciao libraries
      during installation.

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      It is possible that you will see some such errors while
      compiling the Ciao libraries during installation. This is
      specially the case if you are installing a Beta or Alpha release
      of Ciao. These releases (which have ``odd'' version numbers such
      as 1.5 or 2.1) are typically snapshots of the development
      directories, on which many developers are working
      simultaneously, which may include libraries which have typically
      not been tested yet as much as the ``official'' distributions
      (those with ``even'' version numbers such as 1.6 or 2.8). Thus,
      minor warnings may not have been eliminated yet or even errors
      can sneak in. These warnings and errors should not affect the
      overall operation of the system (e.g., if you do not use the
      affected library).

@item @bf{Problem:}

      In Windows, many programs (including @tt{emacs} and @tt{ciao})
      exit with error messages like:

      @tt{Doing vfork: resource temporarily unavailable}

      @bf{Possible reason and solution:}

      Cygwin needs a special memory layout to implement the fork
      semantics in Win32
      (@href{http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-05/msg00413.html}).  A
      workaround this problem is using the @tt{rebaseall} command,
      which relocates all Cygwin DLLs into a layout that avoids
      collisions:

      @begin{itemize}
      @item 1. End all cygwin processes.
      @item 2. Run @tt{/bin/rebaseall} from @tt{c:\cygwin\bin\ash}
               (probably as administrator)
      @end{itemize}

@end{itemize}

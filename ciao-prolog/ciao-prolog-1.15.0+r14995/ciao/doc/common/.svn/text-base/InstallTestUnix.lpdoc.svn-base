@begin{itemize}

@item Typing @apl{ciao} (or @apl{ciaosh}) should start the typical
      Prolog-style top-level shell. 

@item In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
      correctly. Type for example @tt{use_module(library(dec10_io))} --you
      should get back a prompt with no errors reported.

      @comment{See the Ciao manuals (and the examples in
      @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/examples/suite} and @tt{$(CIAOSRC)/examples}).}

@item To exit the top level shell, type @tt{halt.} as usual, or
      @key{^D}.

@item Typing @apl{ciaoc} should produce the help message from the Ciao
      @concept{standalone compiler}.

@item Typing @apl{ciao-shell} should produce a message saying
      that no code was found. This is a Ciao application which can be
      used to write @concept{scripts} written in Ciao, i.e., files
      which do not need any explicit compilation to be run. 

@end{itemize}

@noindent 
Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

@begin{itemize} 

@item If the @apl{info} program is installed, typing @tt{info} should
      produce a list of manuals which @em{should include Ciao
      manual(s) in a separate area} (you may need to log out and back
      in so that your shell variables are reinitialized for this to
      work).

@item Opening with a @concept{WWW browser} (e.g., @apl{netscape}) the
      directory or @tt{URL} corresponding to the @tt{DOCDIR} setting 
      should show a series of Ciao-related manuals. Note that
      @index{style sheets} should be activated for correct formatting
      of the manual.

@item Typing @tt{man ciao} should produce a man page with some very
      basic general information on Ciao (and pointing to the on-line
      manuals).

@item The @tt{DOCDIR} directory should contain the manual also in
      the other formats such as @tt{postscript} or @tt{pdf} which
      specially useful for printing. See @ref{Printing manuals (Un*x)}
      for instructions.

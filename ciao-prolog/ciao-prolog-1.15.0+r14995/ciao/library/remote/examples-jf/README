1) Compile server and client ("make" in this directory willdo).
2) Start the server in a host (see [a], below).
3) Start the client (either in the same host, or in a different one).
   The name of the host running the server should be given as the one
   and only argument to the client program (see [a], below).
5) They just run alone, and exit when finished.

[a] There is a simple example in the "run" target of the Mafile in
this directory.

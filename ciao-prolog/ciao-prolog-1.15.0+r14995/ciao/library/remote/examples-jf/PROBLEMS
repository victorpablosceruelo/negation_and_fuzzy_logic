Make sure the network interface is working; I do not why I cannot
access an IP number without it being up (and the FIM connection is not
enough: the name from the FIM is pinochoX).  This causes problems, as
the current_host/1 returns the Internet name (and writes it to the
info file), and client tries to connect to this name and fails.
Patching this file with localhost, instead, works ---- but it is not
really elegant, is it?  Hopefully this won't happen with a real net.

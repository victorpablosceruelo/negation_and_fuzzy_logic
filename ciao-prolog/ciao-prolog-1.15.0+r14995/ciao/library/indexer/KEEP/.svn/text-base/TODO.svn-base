hash.pl - supply an implementation for hash_term/2

low.pl - supply an alternative for must_be/2
         maybe concat_atom/2 could be substituted...

check the role of Mod (module name) in the expansion ...

the transformed code will call things like integer/1, ground/1
    --check these are always available

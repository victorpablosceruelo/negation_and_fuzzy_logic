* client/server: a server and a client written in Ciao Prolog and
communicating using TCP/IP sockets.  The client is threaded; it is
started specifying the number of threads to start.  It returns the
number of socket it is listening to.  The clients are started
specifying the number of requests to make, the machine the server is
running on, and the port to connect to.  Every request is just two
numbers in two different lines which are added by the client, and
result returned to the client, which checks this result.

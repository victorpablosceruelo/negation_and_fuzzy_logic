The @tt{ODBC Database Mediator Server} is a @concept{Win95/NT application}
which provides a generic, socket-based access to information stored in
@concept{ODBC databases}. 

Two Ciao-Prolog libraries, @lib{db_client} and @lib{persdb_sql}, use
this interface. They offer respectively a SQL-level and a Prolog-level
data access. Installation of this server in all @index{Win95/NT
machines} is needed in order to access to any ODBC database running on
such machines.

   @subsection{Software Requirements}
   
   @begin{itemize}

   @item On the database management side, a @concept{Database Manager
   System (DBMS)} and its 32-bit ODBC driver must be
   installed. @concept{ODBC data source}s can then be defined in the
   Win95/NT machine.

   @item On the client-to-database interface side, a @concept{database
   mediator server} must be running. @tt{Server.exe} is the name of this
   Win95/NT executable. See @em{How to install Server.exe} section.

   @item To enable the communication, the Win95/NT machine @concept{IP
   address} and the @concept{port number} used are specified.  Then,
   this port number must be available to this eventuality.

   @bf{Note}: @em{For the moment, the server application listens to
   the machine port 2020. No other port numbers are currenlty
   allowed.}

   @end{itemize}

   @subsection{How to install Server.exe}

   Next are a number of different ways to install @tt{Server.exe}. Try
   the first alternative. If this succeeds, ignore the rest. Else, try
   the next alternative.

   @begin{itemize}

   @item Copy the @concept{shared DLL version} of @tt{Server.exe} to
   the (or each) Win95/NT machine containing the database(s) that you
   want to access. Run it and open an @concept{ODBC data source}. If
   no error is displayed, the @tt{Server} is correctly installed (and
   the following alternatives are unnecessary). Else, this
   @concept{shared DLL version} is probably needing some other
   @concept{DLL libraries} which it cannot find. If the problems are
   related to @concept{MFC libraries} versions, copy @file{MFC42.DLL}
   and @file{MSVCRT.DLL} to the @tt{Server.exe} NT directory and try
   again.

   @item Copy the @concept{static executable} version of
   @tt{Server.exe} to your Win95/NT machine. Run it and open an
   @concept{ODBC data source}. If no error is displayed, @tt{Server}
   is correctly installed (and the following alternatives are
   unnecessary).

   This static executable requires no DLL's. The price to pay is the
   executable size. In theory, any Win95/NT machine with the
   appropiate 32-bit ODBC driver could run this static .exe. But
   theory does not always agree with reality, so maybe the next choice
   will be useful.

   @item Compile the @tt{Server} sources to obtain a shared DLL named 
   @tt{Server.exe}. Use @concept{Visual C++ 5.0} compiler or a later version.

   @end{itemize}

   @subsection{Database Mediator Server directories}

   Two executable versions (dynamic and static versions) are distributed to
   run the @concept{database mediator server} in a Windows NT/95
   environment. Source files are also available. Meaning and differences
   are explained in @em{How to install Server.exe} section.

   @begin{itemize}

   @item @bf{DLLExecutables directory.} Contains @tt{Server} executable
   compiled as a @concept{shared DLL}, and two additional DLL's which
   may be needed (@em{How to install Server.exe} section).

   @item @bf{StaticExecutables directory.} Contains @tt{Server} executable
   statically compiled.

   @item @bf{ServerSources directory.} Contains @tt{Server} source files, 
   written in @concept{Visual C++ 5.0}.

   @end{itemize}

   @subsection{How to install an ODBC 32-bit data source}

   Once the @concept{ODBC driver} is installed, and the @concept{database
   file} is created, you may define an @concept{ODBC data source} making a
   few simple steps (they can slightly differ depending on the
   @concept{Database Manager System (DBMS)} used):

   @begin{itemize}

   @item @em{Start-Settings-Control Panel-ODBC 32}

   @item Choose @em{User DSN} tab if you want the data source only visible
   for you, or @em{System DSN} if you want it to be visible for all the
   NT/W95 users.

   @item Click on the @em{Add} button. Select the @concept{ODBC driver} you
   want to use (e.g. @tt{Sybase SQL Anywhere}, @tt{Microsoft Access
   Driver}, @tt{SQL Server}, ...). Then click @em{Finish}.

   @item  Now you need to fill some fields (they can differ depending on the
   @concept{ODBC driver}): 

        @begin{itemize}
	@item @em{Data Source Name:} this is the source name you are using to connect to.
	@item @em{Description:} field to insert any comment.
	@item @em{User ID, Password:} name and keyword to access to the data source.
	@item @em{Database File:} the main file containing the database (.mdb, .db , ...).
	@item @em{Others(optionals):} database name, server name, ...
        @end{itemize}
   @end{itemize}

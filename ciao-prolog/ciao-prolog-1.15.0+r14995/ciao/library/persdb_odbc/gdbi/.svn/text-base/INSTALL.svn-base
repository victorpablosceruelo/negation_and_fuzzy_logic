INSTALL
*******

Software Requirements
---------------------

   * On the database management side, a Database Manager System
     (DBMS) and its 32-bit ODBC driver must be installed.  ODBC data
     sources can then be defined in the Win95/NT machine.

   * On the client-to-database interface side, a database mediator
     server must be running. `Server.exe' is the name of this
     Win95/NT executable. See _How to install Server.exe_ section.

   * To enable the communication, the Win95/NT machine IP address and
     the port number used are specified. Then, this port number must
     be available to this eventuality.

     *Note:* _For the moment, the server application listens to the
     machine port 2020. No other port numbers are currenlty allowed._


How to install Server.exe
-------------------------

   Next are a number of different ways to install `Server.exe'. Try
the first alternative. If this succeeds, ignore the rest. Else, try
the next alternative.

   * Copy the shared DLL version of `Server.exe' to your Win95/NT
     machine. Run it and open an ODBC data source. If no error is
     displayed, `Server' is correctly installed (and the following
     alternatives are unnecessary). Else, this shared DLL version is
     probably needing some other DLL libraries which it cannot find.
     If the problems are related to MFC libraries versions, copy
     `MFC42.DLL' and `MSVCRT.DLL' to the `Server.exe' NT directory
     and try again.

   * Copy the static executable version of `Server.exe' to your
     Win95/NT machine. Run it and open an ODBC data source. If no
     error is displayed, `Server' is correctly installed (and the
     following alternatives are unnecessary).

     This static executable requires no DLL's. The price to pay is
     the executable size. In theory, any Win95/NT machine with the
     appropiate 32-bit ODBC driver could run this static .exe. But
     theory does not always agree with reality, so maybe the next
     choice will be useful.

   * Compile the `Server' sources to obtain a shared DLL named
     `Server.exe'. Use Visual C++ 5.0 compiler or a later version.


Database Mediator Server directories
------------------------------------

   Two executable versions (dynamic and static versions) are
distributed to run the database mediator server in a Windows NT/95
environment. Source files are also available. Meaning and differences
are explained in _How to install Server.exe_ section.

   * *DLLExecutables directory.* Contains `Server' executable
     compiled as a shared DLL, and two additional DLL's which may be
     needed (_How to install Server.exe_ section).

   * *StaticExecutables directory.* Contains `Server' executable
     statically compiled.

   * *ServerSources directory.* Contains `Server' source files,
     written in Visual C++ 5.0.


How to install an ODBC 32-bit data source
-----------------------------------------

   Once the ODBC driver is installed, and the database file is
created, you may define an ODBC data source making a few simple steps
(they can slightly differ depending on the Database Manager System
(DBMS) used):

   * _Start-Settings-Control Panel-ODBC 32_

   * Choose _User DSN_ tab if you want the data source only visible
     for you, or _System DSN_ if you want it to be visible for all
     the NT/W95 users.

   * Click on the _Add_ button. Select the ODBC driver you want to
     use (e.g. `Sybase SQL Anywhere', `Microsoft Access Driver', `SQL
     Server', ...). Then click _Finish_.

   * Now you need to fill some fields (they can differ depending on
     the ODBC driver):

        * _Data Source Name:_ this is the source name you are using
          to connect to.

        * _Description:_ field to insert any comment.

        * _User ID, Password:_ name and keyword to access to the data
          source.

        * _Database File:_ the main file containing the database
          (.mdb, .db , ...).

        * _Others(optionals):_ database name, server name, ...

   The `ODBC Database Mediator Server' is a Win95/NT application
which provides a generic, socket-based access to information stored in
ODBC databases.

   Two Ciao-Prolog libraries, `db_client' and `persdb_sql', use this
interface. They offer respectively a SQL-level and a Prolog-level
data access. Installation of this server in all _Win95/NT machines_
is needed in order to access to any ODBC database running on such
machines.

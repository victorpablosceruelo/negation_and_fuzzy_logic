 How to install a ODBC 32-bit data source
 ========================================

 Once the ODBC driver is installed, and the database file is created,
you may define an ODBC data source making a few simple steps (they can
slightly differ depending on the database manager used):

 Start-Settings-Control Panel-ODBC 32

 Choose 'User DSN' tab if you want the data source only visible for
you, or 'System DSN' if you want it to be visible for all the NT/W95
users.  Click on the 'Add' button. Select the ODBC driver you want to
use (e.g. Sybase SQL Anywhere, Microsoft Access Driver, SQL Server,
...). Then click 'Finish'.

 Now you to fill some fields (they can differ depending on the ODBC driver): 

	Data Source Name.  - This is the source name you are using to
        connect to. 
	Description. 	   - Field to insert any comment.
	User ID, Password. - Name and keyword to access to the data source.
	Database File.	   - The main file containing the database
        (.mdb, .db , ...). 
	Others(optionals). - Database name, Server name, ...

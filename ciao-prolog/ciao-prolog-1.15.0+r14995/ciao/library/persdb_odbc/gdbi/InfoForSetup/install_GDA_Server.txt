	=====================================
	==Generic Database Access interface==
	=====================================

	This directory contains the executable files to run the
Generic Database Access Server in a Windows NT/95
environment. ´Server´ application lets CIAO Prolog access to
predicates stored in an ODBC database (SQL persistent predicates
library).

	To install it, copy 'Server.exe' to the database machine (for
more considerations, see below). 32 bits ODBC is needed. The ODBC data
source must be defined (and its ODBC driver installed). For more
information about installing ODBC data sources, see
INSTALL_ODBC_SOURCE.TXT .

	The application has been developed using Visual C++ 5.0 and
the MFC's.

	Two executable versions are distributed : 

	- First is a shared DLL. Some others DLL's can be
required. Try this option first.

	- Second is a static compilation. Size requirements are
bigger, but DLL requirements are smaller (32 bits ODBC is needed, but
not much more). If you can't run with this option, please let us know
(sources are also distributed, so you can compile it if you have
Visual C++ 5.0 or later).

	DLLExecutables directory
	------------------------

	This directory contains Server executable (Server.exe)
compiled as a shared DLL, and two additional DLL's which maybe can be
needed. Try first with this EXE file.  In an environment with Visual
C++ 5.0 (or later) the DLL will be enough to run the application. If
you have problems with MFC versions, copy MFC42.DLL and MSVCRT.DLL
files in the same directory as Server.exe and try again. If the
problem persists, try the next option.

	StaticExecutables directory
	---------------------------

	If the previous try wasn't successful, copy the static version
of Server.exe . If the application still doesn't work, please, contact
us (you can also compile the sources with Visual C++ 5.0, of course if
you use it).

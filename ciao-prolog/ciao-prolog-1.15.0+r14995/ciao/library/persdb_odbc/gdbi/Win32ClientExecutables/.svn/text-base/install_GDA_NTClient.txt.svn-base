
	'Client' application runs a simple NT/W95 interface to use the 'Generic Database Access Server' commands. These commands are a basic set to access to databases from NT/W95 using SQL sentences (see Readme_GDA_User.txt, GDAServerCommands.txt for more details). 

Installation
============
See install_GDA_Server.TXT ('Client' setup is almost the same as
'Server' setup).

   for predicates defined by facts. This is useful for huge tables of
   facts that may push the memory limits of the system too far. Goals of a
   cached predicate are 
   executed simply by reading from the corresponding file. Anything in the file
   different from a fact for the corresponding predicate is ignored. Each call
   to a predicate cached in this way forces opening the file, so the use
   of this package is subject to the limit on the number of open files
   that the system can support.").

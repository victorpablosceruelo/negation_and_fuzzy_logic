:- doc(module,"This library provides support for obtaining a graph of
        crossed-references between the source code in different files.
        The graph identifies calls from clauses in one file which match
	the name of a predicate defined in another file.

        The graph has directed edges between the file names, the meaning 
        of which depends on the selected type of crossed-references. For
        crossed-references of type @tt{whouses} edges point to files
        that ""use"" predicates defined in the edge source, i.e., edge
        source defines predicates (in edge label) which are used (called)
        by edge sink. For crossed-references of type @tt{whodefs} edges
        point to files that define predicates used by the edge source,
        i.e., edge source uses (calls) predicates which are defined in 
        edge sink. An edge sink @tt{0} indicates that the edge has no real
        sink. 

        The library works as follows. The files which are
        taken into account to construct the graph are set by the
        predicate @tt{set_files/1}. The kind of links between these files
        that will be included as graph edges are set by the predicate
        @tt{set_flag/1}. Then, predicates @tt{xrefs_lgraph/2} and 
        @tt{xrefs_ugraph/2} construct the labeled (@tt{lgraph}) or
        unlabeled (@tt{ugraph}) graph.").

/* Client
   It should be invoked as "client File"
   It will read File (which should contain XML) and send its contents
   in a SOAP message via HTTP to the server identified in conexion/2

   The application protocol is supposed to be asynchronous, so that the
   message is sent and the only answer received back is a confirmation
   of reception. In a synchronous protocol the answer could contain
   a true response.

   In the present case, a true response, if any, would have to come in 
   a different message. To receive such messages the server part should 
   be used. See server.pl

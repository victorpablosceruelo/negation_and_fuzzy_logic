/* Server
   It should be invoked as "server Num"
   It will start a server process bound to socket Num that will receive
   messages on that port. The server id is thus www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es:Num

   The application protocol is supposed to be asynchronous, so that only
   a confirmation of reception is sent back. In a synchronous protocol 
   a true response could be sent back altogether.

   In the present case, a true response, if any, would have to be sent
   as a different message. To send such messages the client part should 
   be used. See client.pl

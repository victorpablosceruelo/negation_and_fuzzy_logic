:- doc(module,"

@pred{when/2} delays a predicate until some condition in its variable
is met.  For example, we may want to find out the maximum of two
numbers, but we are not sure when they will be instantiated.  We can
write the standard @pred{max/3} predicate (but changing its name to
@pred{gmax/3} to denote that the first and second arguments must be
ground) as

@begin{verbatim}
gmax(X, Y, X):- X > Y, !.
gmax(X, Y, Y):- X =< Y.
@end{verbatim}

and then define a 'safe' @pred{max/3} as 


@begin{verbatim}
max(X, Y, Z):-
        when((ground(X),ground(Y)), gmax(X, Y, Z)).
@end{verbatim}

which can be called as follows:

@begin{verbatim}
?- max(X, Y, Z) , Y = 0, X = 8.

X = 8,
Y = 0,
Z = 8 ? 

yes
@end{verbatim}

Alternatively, @pred{max/3} could have been defined as 

@begin{verbatim}
max(X, Y, Z):-
        when(ground((X, Y)), gmax(X, Y, Z)).
@end{verbatim}

with the same effects as above.  More complex implementations are
possible.  Look, for example, at the @tt{max.pl} implementation under
the @tt{when} library directory, where a @pred{max/3} predicate is
implemented which waits on all the arguments until there is enough
information to determine their values:

@begin{verbatim}
?- use_module(library(when(max))).

yes
?- max(X, Y, Z), Z = 5, Y = 4.

X = 5,
Y = 4,
Z = 5 ? 

yes
@end{verbatim}

condition checking.

In case that an instantiation fires the execution of several
predicates, the order in which these are executed is not defined.".

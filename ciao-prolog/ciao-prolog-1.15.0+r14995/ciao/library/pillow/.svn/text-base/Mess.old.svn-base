public domain HTML/HTTP library for LP and CLP systems.  Enjoy!

Description
-----------

This package is a public domain HTML/HTTP conectivity package for
Logic Programming and Constraint Logic Programming systems. It is an
evolution of the previously released html.pl package (in fact it
includes html.pl version 96.2.1b). The package allows generating HTML
documents easily from LP/CLP systems, including HTML forms. It also
provides facilities for parsing the input provided by HTML forms, as
well as developing form handlers. Lastly, it includes support for the
HTTP protocol as a builtin.  Its overall purpose is to facilitate the
development of WWW applications using LP and CLP systems.  The package
has been developed in the context of the &-Prolog and CIAO systems,
but it has been adapted to a number of popular LP/CLP systems. In
particular, the SICStus (2.1 or 3) ports support all the package
functionality.

   implements the PiLLoW library @cite{pillow-ws-dist-short}.  The
   following three chapters document, respectively, the predicates for
   HTML/XML/CGI programming, the predicate for HTTP conectivity, and
   the types used in the definition of the predicates (key for fully
   understanding the other predicates).  You can find a paper and some
   additional information in the @file{library/pillow/doc} directory
   of the distribution, and in the WWW at
   @href{http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/pillow/pillow.html}. There
   is also a @index{PiLLoW on-line tutorial} (slides) at
   @href{http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/logalg/slides/C_pillow/C_pillow.html} which
   illustrates the basic features and provides a number of examples of
   PiLLoW use.

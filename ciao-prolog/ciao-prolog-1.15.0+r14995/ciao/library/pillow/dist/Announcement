PiLLoW 1.1 is available!

PiLLoW version 1.1, included with the latest version of Ciao Prolog
(1.6#1), is now available for SICStus 3.8, SWI Prolog 3.3, and YAP
4.3.0.  Improvements from the previous version include handling of XML
code, templates (HTML/XML code with 'named holes' which are associated
to logical variables), and a reference manual.  Please see:

for details. 

The PiLLoW library (``Programming in Logic Languages on the Web'') is
a public domain Internet/WWW programming library for Logic Programming
Systems which simplifies the process of writing applications for this
environment.  The library provides facilities for generating HTML or
XML structured documents by handling them as Herbrand terms, producing
HTML forms, writing form handlers, processing HTML templates,
accessing and parsing WWW documents (either HTML or XML), accessing
code posted at HTTP addresses, etc.  The PiLLoW library has been
developed in the context of the &-Prolog and Ciao systems, but it has
been adapted to a number of popular Logic Programming systems.  PiLLoW
is distributed under the GNU Library General Public License.

P.S. If you have ported PiLLoW to other Prologs, please let us know!

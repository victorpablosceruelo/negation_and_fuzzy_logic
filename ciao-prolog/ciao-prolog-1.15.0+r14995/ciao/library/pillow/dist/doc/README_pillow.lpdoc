@begin{description}

@item{@tt{doc}} contains an article in different formats explaining Web
  programming in PiLLoW, and in non-Ciao distributions (in Ciao the
  PiLLoW manual is inside the Ciao manual) the manual in three formats:
  in GNU info in @tt{pillow_doc.info}, suitable for consulting in the
  emacs editor; in Postscript in @tt{pillow_doc.ps}, for printing in a
  Postscript printer or visualizing with @tt{ghostview} or similar
  program; and in HTML inside the directory @tt{pillow_doc_html}.

@item{@tt{examples}} contains programming examples, prepared to run in
  the Ciao system, but easily adaptable to other Logic Programming systems.

@item{@tt{images}} contains images used by the PiLLoW library or the examples.

 This compiler FAILS BECAUSE pl2sql creates table aliases, e.g: 

SELECT * FROM table rel1 WHERE rel1.Id=1

If we use the FROM and WHERE clauses into a deletion sentence, SQL
Anywhere returns a syntax error. 'From clauses' are not consistent in
SQL Anywhere 5.0 (they are different in select and deletion
statements, despite their documentation says), and that make the
deletion statement to fail.

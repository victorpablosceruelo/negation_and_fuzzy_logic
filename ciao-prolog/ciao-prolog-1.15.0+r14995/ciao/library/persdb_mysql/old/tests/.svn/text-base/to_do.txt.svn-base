Always: update versions and documentation

New Facilities
++++++++++++++

- New predicate to automatically convert sql_persistent predicates into file
persistent predicates 
- SQL data types mapping to Prolog checking types (different SQL data types
depending on the SQL manufacturer)
- Tables creation,deletion : add a "closer to Prolog" way to deal with tables.

Additionals:
- Server 
  * Tests: robustness, errors dealing
  * Timeouts in connections
  * Efficiency questions: not expirable connections
  * Interactive facilities: get_tables, table_types
  * Documentation

Internal Implementation Improvements
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Deletion Compiler (use a deletion SQL sentence instead a view deletion, to
 keep compatibility with different ODBC versions).
- pl2sql : repair it to avoid writing in a temporal file (revisit and
test the last solution tried)
- string2term : change it to avoid writing in a temporal file.

- Conjunction of several external predicates : translate it to a single
 query. Also disjunctions, ...


TO REPAIR
=========
=========
- Review view creation in deletion, ...
- Tests: errors, responses to unexpected situations, ...
	 * add timeouts in connections
	 * text errors : lost letters, aphostrophes and other extended-ASCII
characters, ...
	 * review connections when server is off	 

TO DO IN OTHER LIBRARIES

- Review socket_recv_code/3

@cindex{Java to Prolog interface}
This module defines the Prolog side of the Java to Prolog interface. This side
of the interface only has one public predicate: a server
that listens at the socket connection with Java, and executes the commands
received from the Java side.

In order to evaluate the goals received from the Java side, this module can
work in two ways: executing them in the same engine, or starting a thread
for each goal. The easiest way is to launch them in the same engine, but
the goals must be evaluated sequentially: once a goal provides the first
solution, all the subsequent goals must be finished before this goal can
backtrack to provide another solution. The Prolog side of this interface
works as a top-level, and the goals partially evaluated are not
independent.

The solution of this goal dependence is to evaluate the goals in a
different prolog engine. Although Ciao includes a mechanism to evaluate
goals in different engines, the approach used in this interface is to
launch each goal in a different thread.

The decision of what kind of goal evaluation is selected is done by the
Java side. Each evaluation type has its own command terms, so the Java side
can choose the type it needs.

A Prolog server starts by calling the @tt{prolog_server/0} predicate,
or by calling @tt{prolog_server/1} predicate and providing the port
number as argument. The user predicates and libraries to be called
from Java must be included in the executable file, or be accesible
using the built-in predicates dealing with code loading.

% Contains the exception thrown when launching a goal
:- concurrent exception_flag/2.

% Contains the solutions generated from the Prolog goals that
% are waiting to be requested from the Java side. Once the solution
% is obtained by the corresponding thread, it is not automatically
% returned to the other side of the interface. The solution is stored
% in this fact, and is sent to the Java side when a next_solution
% request is received.
:- concurrent query_solutions/2.

% Contains the requests for next solution/termination.
% When the Java side requests next solution or the termination of
% a given goal, the interface asserts a fact with its query Id, in
% order to allow the thread that is processing the goal can continue
% executing it to get the next solution, or just terminate
% its execution.
% Second argument must be the atoms 'next_solution' or 'terminate'.
:- concurrent query_requests/2.

% Contains the list of queries launched from Java and no terminated

@begin{itemize}

@item @tt{prolog_launch_query(Q)} Compound term to create a new query,
	received as single argument of this structure. A reference to the
	new query is returned to Java.

@item @tt{prolog_next_solution} Atom to get the next solution
	of a goal. A term representing the goal instantiated with the 
        next solution is returned to Java.

@item @tt{prolog_execute} Atom to indicate that next solution of a
	goal must be got, without blocking the requester (it has to check 
        if this goal is still running using prolog_is_running command).

@item @tt{prolog_terminate_query} Atom to indicate that a goal must be 
        terminated.

@item @tt{prolog_use_module(M)} Compound term to load dynamically a 
        module given as argument.

@item @tt{prolog_is_running} Atom to check if a goal is yet running a
        prolog_execute command.

@item @tt{prolog_halt} Atom to terminate the current Prolog process.

   are composed using binary operators. This is really useful because
   most of the grammars used in many applications (for example
   @apl{lpmake}) are built using binary (and unary) operators. For
   example a ficticious lpmake entry like

@tt{entry_point <- [list_of_dependencies] :- ...}

Would express that @tt{entry_point} would be executed after
@tt{list_of_dependencies} would be already processed. But many times
the user will desire to write something like:

@tt{entry_point <- :- ...}

to specify that there are no dependencies. But when processing it, the
programmer desires to see:

@tt{entry_point <- [] :- ...}

This is exactly what this package do, complete the fields that user
does not fill-in.").

      @item Reorder operators. Now that (unary) operators have
            changed, reading the term can change the order of building
            it (i.e., '+'(_,'-'(_)) is different than '+'('-'(_,_),_)
            for example) due to priorities.

      @item Get the pattern of the new reordered term (The unfilled
            fields will become in variables).

      @item Now it is as easy as unify the patterns, i.e., make the
            free variables from the previous point get bound to the
            default corresponding value in the @var{Op} patter.

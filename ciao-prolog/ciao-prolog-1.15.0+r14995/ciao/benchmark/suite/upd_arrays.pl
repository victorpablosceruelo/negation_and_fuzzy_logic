primitives for the creation, access, and modification of arrays.
Modification can be performed monotonically (i.e., instantiating
variables inside the array) or destructively (i.e., replacing
components inside the array using @pred{setarg/3}).

Destructive assignment, besides being @bf{against} the spirit of Logic
Programming, is slower than creating an array full of free, unique
variables, and then instantiating these variables.  If the intended
use of the array is to create it and then use its contents, we
recommend creating an array full of free variables and instanting them
rather than setting an initial value for the array compnentes and then
updating the array cells.

The library @ref{arrays} might also be of interest to the reader

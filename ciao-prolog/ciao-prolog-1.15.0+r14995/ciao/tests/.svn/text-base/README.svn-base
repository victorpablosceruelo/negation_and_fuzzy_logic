Remember to try some tests where the user who compiles and installs is
not the one which makes the tests, in order to ensure that all of the
pieces are compiled correctly!!!

How to use those tests
----------------------

Since something strange is happening (repeated partial compilations
make user C files not to be loaded), I recomment to use:

    make test-local

and 

    make test

which clean, build, and execute, either using the same installation
the tests are in, or some default installations (i.e., using whatever
ciaoc is in the path).

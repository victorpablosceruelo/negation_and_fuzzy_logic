The driver for the code is in

test_iso_conformance.pl

(see NOTE at the bottom; type 'make' for a quick message on how to use
it).  This (of ocurse probably won't work if your prolog doesn't
conform to the standard.  In fact it doesn't work for three cases that
I have tried.  After loading the driver files you then call the goal

run_tests.

The results appear at the console.

A word on errors raised by is/2. The standard is somewhat ambiguous on
this.  Section 7.9.2 of the standard says that evaluation has only one
type_error namely evaluable.  But all the error listings in 9.4.x.3
use integer in their type errors.  Generally I have preferred the
former in this version of the suite, besides this is consistent with
what is done in the rest of clause 9.  However if the argument is
evaluable, but not of the required type eg a float when an integer is
expected then one should throw type_error(integer, 7.5) so this is
what the suite expects.


NOTE by MCL:
     
    vanilla.pl has been change to test_iso_conformance.pl.  This file
    can compile into a standalone executable and be run.


CAUTION:
        
    Do NOT change the data files in this directory.  They are directly
    read by the test cases.  In order to clean up the directory, use
    only 'make clean' (remove the .po, .itf files) or 'make realclean'
    (remove also the executable).

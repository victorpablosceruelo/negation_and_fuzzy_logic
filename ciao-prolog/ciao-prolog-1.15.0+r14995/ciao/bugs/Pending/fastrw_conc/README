- writer.pl implements a toy example of a program sending a term
  through a socket and receiving an ack, using fastrw, as respose.

- reader.pl implements a toy example of a program reading a term form
  a socket and sending an ack, using fastrw, as response.

 * Problem: In any case, the reader receives the term but if the
   connection is established by a thread, the ack never gets to the
   writer until the execution of the reader is aborted.

* Execution: Run two ciao shells, one for the reader and another for
  the writer and execute main in each, beginning with the reader. Then
  the execution will apparently hang. To make it finish, abort the
  reader. If not using threads, the behavior is normal.

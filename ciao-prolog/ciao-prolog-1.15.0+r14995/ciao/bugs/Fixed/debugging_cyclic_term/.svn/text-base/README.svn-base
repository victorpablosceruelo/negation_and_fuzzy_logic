Debugging goals with cyclic terms produced an infinite loop in the
debugger.

1.- Load 'inf_term.pl' in trace mode.
2.- Call main/0.
3.- Step on the debugger.  The 5th line Ciao hangs, and it aborts after
    a while (with a "Memory allocated out of addressable bounds" error).

This bug has been distilled from the debugger_bug_curry_translation one.

                      Rationale for the Open Source Definition

        The intent of the Open Source Definition is to write down a concrete
        set of criteria that we believe capture the essence of what the
        software development community wants ``Open Source'' to mean --
        criteria that ensure that software distributed under an open-source
        license will be available for independent peer review and continuous
        evolutionary improvement and selection, reaching levels of
        reliability and power no closed product can attain.

        For the evolutionary process to work, we have to counter short-term
        incentives for people to stop contributing to the software gene
        pool. This means the license terms must prevent people from locking
        up software where very few people can see or modify it.

        When software developers distribute their software under OSI
        approved software licenses, they can apply the "OSI Certified" mark
        to that software. This certification mark informs users of that
        software that the license complies with the intent of the Open
        Source Definition. More information about our certification mark and
        program is available here.

        1. Free Redistribution (back)

        By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we
        eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order
        to make a few short-term sales dollars. If we didn't do this, there
        would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect.

        2. Source Code (back)

        We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't
        evolve programs without modifying them. Since our purpose is to make
        evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy.

        3. Derived Works (back)

        The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent
        peer review and rapid evolutionary selection. For rapid evolution to
        happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute
        modifications.

        4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code (back)

        Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but users have a
        right to know who is responsible for the software they are using.
        Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they're
        being asked to support and protect their reputations.

        Accordingly, an open-source license must guarantee that source be
        readily available, but may require that it be distributed as
        pristine base sources plus patches. In this way, "unofficial"
        changes can be made available but readily distinguished from the
        base source.

        5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups. (back)

        In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum
        diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to
        contribute to open sources. Therefore we forbid any open-source
        license from locking anybody out of the process.

        Some countries, including the United States, have export
        restrictions for certain types of software. An OSD-conformant
        license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind
        them that they are obliged to obey the law; however, it may not
        incorporate such restrictions itself.

        6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor. (back)

        The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that
        prevent open source from being used commercially. We want commercial
        users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.

        7. Distribution of License. (back)

        This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect
        means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.

        8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product. (back)

        This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps.

        9. License Must Not Contaminate Other Software. (back)

        Distributors of open-source software have the right to make their
        own choices about their own software.

        Yes, the GPL is conformant with this requirement. GPLed libraries
        `contaminate' only software to which they will actively be linked at
        runtime, not software with which they are merely distributed.

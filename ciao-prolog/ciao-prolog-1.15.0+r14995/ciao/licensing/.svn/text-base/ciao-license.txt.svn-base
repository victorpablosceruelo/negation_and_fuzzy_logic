		 CIAO-PROLOG LICENSE GRANTED TO MOTOROLA

[This license is a modified version of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License version 2.1]

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MOTOROLA MAY COPY, 
             DISTRIBUTE AND MODIFY CIAO-PROLOG

  0. This License ("Agreement") applies to all software distributed by
Contractor to Motorola as part of the services to be provided by
contractor.  This software is collectively referred to as
"Ciao-Prolog".

  A "work based on Ciao-Prolog" means either Ciao-Prolog or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
Ciao-Prolog or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For Ciao-Prolog, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of Ciao-Prolog.

  The "GNU LGPL" means the GNU Lesser General Public License version
2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this Agreement; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using Ciao-Prolog is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on Ciao-Prolog (independent of the use of Ciao-Prolog in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what Ciao-Prolog does
and what the program that uses Ciao-Prolog does.
  
  1. Motorola may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Ciao-Prolog's
complete source code as Motorola receives it, in any medium, provided
that Motorola conspicuously and appropriately publishes on each copy
an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to the GNU LGPL and to the absence
of any warranty; and distribute a copy of the GNU LGPL along with
Ciao-Prolog.

  Motorola may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and Motorola may at Motorola's option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee.

  2. Motorola may modify Motorola's copy or copies of Ciao-Prolog or
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on Ciao-Prolog, and copy
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that Motorola also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) Motorola must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that Motorola changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) Motorola must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of GNU LGPL.

    d) If a facility in the modified Ciao-Prolog refers to a function
    or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
    uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
    facility is invoked, then Motorola must make a good faith effort
    to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
    function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from Ciao-Prolog,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this Agreement, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when Motorola distribute them as separate works.  But when
Motorola distributes the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on Ciao-Prolog, the distribution of the whole must be on
the terms of the GNU LGPL, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
Motorola's rights to work written entirely by Motorola; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on Ciao-Prolog.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on Ciao-Prolog
with Ciao-Prolog (or with a work based on Ciao-Prolog) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of the GNU LGPL.

  3. Motorola may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
Public License instead of the GNU LGPL to a given copy of Ciao-Prolog.
To do this, Motorola must alter all the notices that refer to the
LGPL, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
version 2, instead of to the GNU LGPL.  (If a newer version than
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,
then Motorola can specify that version instead if Motorola wishes.)
Do not make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when Motorola wish to copy part of the code of
Ciao-Prolog into a program that is not a library.

  4. Motorola may copy and distribute Ciao-Prolog (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that Motorola
accompanies it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of
Ciao-Prolog, but is designed to work with Ciao-Prolog by being
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses Ciao-Prolog".
Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of Ciao-Prolog,
and therefore falls outside the scope of this Agreement.

  However, linking a "work that uses Ciao-Prolog" with Ciao-Prolog
creates an executable that is a derivative of Ciao-Prolog (because it
contains portions of Ciao-Prolog), rather than a "work that uses
Ciao-Prolog".  The executable is therefore covered by this
Agreement. Note, however, that the use of such executable is not
restricted by this agreement. If the executable is distributed, then
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of
Ciao-Prolog will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of Ciao-Prolog, Motorola may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with Ciao-Prolog itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, Motorola may also combine
or link a "work that uses Ciao-Prolog" with Ciao-Prolog to produce a
work containing portions of Ciao-Prolog, and distribute that work
under terms of Motorola's choice, provided that:

 a) Motorola includes in a conspicuous location in the distribution of
 the "work that uses Ciao-Prolog" a file named README whose contents
 are the following:

   Parts of this program have been generated using the Ciao-Prolog
   system.

   The Ciao-Prolog system is 
   Copyright (c) 1990-2000 Technical University of Madrid.

   The Ciao-Prolog system is available at no charge from
   http://www.ciaoprolog.org in either source-code or precompiled form
   for several widely used platforms.

   The file CIAO-LICENSE contains terms and conditions for copying,
   distribution and modification of Ciao-Prolog.

   Note, however that this application contains parts which are 
   Copyright (C) Motorola and thus the exact terms for copying,
   distribution and modification of this program are those stated in
   MOTOROLA-LICENSE.

 b)  Motorola must supply a copy of the GNU LGPL in the distribution,
 in a file named CIAO-LICENSE.

  7. Motorola may place library facilities that are a work based on
Ciao-Prolog side-by-side in a single library together with other
library facilities not covered by this Agreement, and distribute such a
combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
based on Ciao-Prolog and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that Motorola does these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on Ciao-Prolog, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    GNU LGLP.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on Ciao-Prolog, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. Motorola may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute Ciao-Prolog except as expressly provided under this
Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
with, or distribute Ciao-Prolog is void, and will automatically
terminate Motorola's rights under this License.  However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from Motorola under this Agreement
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
in full compliance.

  9. Each time Motorola redistributes Ciao-Prolog (or any work based
on Ciao-Prolog), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
Ciao-Prolog subject to the terms and conditions of the GNU LGPL.
Motorola may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein.  Motorola is not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with the GNU LGPL.

  10. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on Motorola (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this Agreement, they
do not excuse Motorola from the conditions of this Agreement.  If
Motorola cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Motorola's
obligations under this Agreement and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence Motorola may not distribute Ciao-Prolog at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of Ciao-Prolog by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through Motorola, then the only way Motorola could
satisfy both it and this Agreement would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of Ciao-Prolog.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  11. If the distribution and/or use of Ciao-Prolog is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places Ciao-Prolog under this Agreement may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this Agreement incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this Agreement.

  12. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the GNU LGPL from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the current version, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Motorola has
the option of following the terms and conditions either of version 2.1
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If Motorola wishes to incorporate parts of Ciao-Prolog into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
with these, Motorola must write to the authors of Ciao-Prolog to ask
for permission.  

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE Ciao-Prolog IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR Ciao-Prolog, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE Ciao-Prolog "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD Ciao-Prolog PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE Ciao-Prolog AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF Ciao-Prolog TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

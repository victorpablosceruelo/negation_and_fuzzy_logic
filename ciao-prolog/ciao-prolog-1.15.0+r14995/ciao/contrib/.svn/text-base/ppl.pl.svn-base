Polyhedra Library (PPL). It is a patched version of the interface
available in the source code of PPL 0.9 (Warning : It should not work
with any other version of PPL). For more information about the
predicates provided by the interface, refer to the Parma Polyhedra
Library webpage @href{http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/Applications/}.

If PPL is not available during the compilation of ciao, a dummy
interface will be substituted. In this case a @tt{PPL library not
installed} error will be raised at loading of the module.").

Some integer factorization algorithms. 

NOTES:

- Do not use for serious purposes (there exists much better algorithms
  and implementations).

- Use the Self Initializing Quadratic Sieve or the Elliptic Curve
  Method for fast results.

- This is a candidate code for improvements in the module system (by
  describing common properties/predicates as interfaces).

- Complexity and termination properties may be very different across
  algorithms (some of them should be run with a time-out).

- The implementation may be buggy, but the programs can be used as
  benchmarks for numeric operations.

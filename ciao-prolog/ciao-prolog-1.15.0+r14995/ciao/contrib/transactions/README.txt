I was able to complete the entire task that MH and I agreed upon
early on.  If this is deemed suitable for inclusion in the Ciao
distribution there is a small cleanup task and more extensive
testing to do.  For a place to start, refer to the Summary in
the documentation at 
http://cs.unm.edu/~nickp/transactional_semantics/transactionsrt.html 
and file transaction_test.pl

Enjoy...

CiaoDHT
========

CiaoDHT is a simple implementation of distributed hash tables (DHT)
using native CiaoProlog primitives.

Compilation
===========
Compilation step consists of two parts: 
 - compilation of server

 - compilation of client.

Both files are supplied in this directory. In order to compile them
you may use following command:

ciaoc *.pl


Distribution
============
At this step it is important to understand that full power of any DHT
is its distibuted performance. Therefore, to play with it you would
probaly like to have several machines at your disposal. If that is the
case you  can go on with any of following ways:
 - install a CiaoProlog distribution on each of them and compile
   server.pl and client.pl two files separately.

 - compile server.pl once and redistribute it to other hosts in
   whatever manner you preffer (floppy disks, FTP, SSH, or printing
   out the binary and then give it to your secretary to type - just
   jocking)

Startup
=======
Once distribution step is performed, you start nodes of your DHT one
by one. First of them can be simply started with following command:

server

Each subsequent node should be started with some reference to
existing nodes. Such reference may be specified as '--join-host'
command line option:

server --join-host <address>

In this template <address> may be an optional IP or DNS address of any
machine on which a DHT server is already running.

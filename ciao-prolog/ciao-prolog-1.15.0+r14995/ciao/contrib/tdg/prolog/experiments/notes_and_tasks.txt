- TDG of memb/2: There are problems (probably due to the way I transform
  negated unifs).
- Div points should depend on the mode, or we should not allow
multi-moded preds
x Accurately specify divergence points (unifs with out_vars cannot fail).
- Add support to natively handle unifications in the meta_interpreter.
x Include NCPs to distinguish between textual and non-textual fails.
- Try to implement another meta-interpreter in which the CPs are
  returned by main so that we can resume on choice points of called
  preds.
x Automate things -> modes, etc.
- Study which vars can be safely eliminated from the residual
  programs.
x Test to TDG

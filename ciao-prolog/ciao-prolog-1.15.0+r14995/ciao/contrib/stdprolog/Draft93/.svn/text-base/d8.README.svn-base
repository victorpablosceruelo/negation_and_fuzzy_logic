The files in this directory contain the March 1993 draft ISO Prolog
standard, in PostScript, in five parts, plus a cover page.

(The last part is an appendix on formal semantics; if what you want
is the syntax of the language, you need only the first three parts.)

Draft Prolog standard -- IS CD 13211-1, March 1993

The draft International Prolog standard is stored as five PostScript files

   0  Editor's foreword
   1  Pages i-v, 1-23 -- Contents, Definitions, Syntax
   2  Pages 24-63 -- Semantic concepts, Built-in predicates
   3  Pages 64-101 -- Built-in prediactes, Evaluable functors
   4  Pages 121-171 -- Formal semantics

   ( This version of the draft does not contain pages 102-120 because
   all of it is printed in 9pt type. The version distributed by ISO/IEC
   and to WG17 members has all the text except the Formal semantics in 
   10pt type, and has page numbers 1-viii, 1-171 ).

The reference identifier in WG17 of this draft is ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 N110.  
More generally, it is

   Committee Draft ISO/IEC CD 13211-1.

(the '-1' indicate Part 1. Modules will be, eventually, IS 13211-2;
   CD is an acronym for `Committee Draft').

The is also being circulated to national Standards bodies
(e.g. AFNOR, ANSI, DIN, etc) for ballot: the primary question
is "Do you approve this CD?" Each standards body must vote
"Yes", or "Yes with comments", or "No with comments" (this is
a simplification, but your standards body will know what to do).
 
The ballot period will run from April 8 to July 16 1993, and the
comments will be resolved at WG17's meeting in Boston (USA) 18-20
August 1993.  WG17 will then report to the SC22 plenary meeting (Paris,
20-24 September) whether we have reached agreement, or need to have
another CD ballot.  If the vote is successful, another draft will be
circulated as a DIS (Draft International Standard).

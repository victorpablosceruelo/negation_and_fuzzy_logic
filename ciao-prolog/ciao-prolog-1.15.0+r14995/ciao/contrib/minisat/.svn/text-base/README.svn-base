You need to put the file swi-minisat.tgz in a directory where you want
the solver and the interface and then do:

% tar zxvf swi-minisat.tgz
% ./configure.sh
% make
% make clean

The paths in Makefile are good for the most recent SWI (5.6.7) installed
from the standard Linux package (RPM). Otherwise, it may require manual
tuning of paths in Makefile. It also takes a reasonably fresh 'gcc'.

In the Prolog files which use the library you need to (a) tell SWI
Prolog where the library is installed and (b) load the library:

:- assertz(user:library_directory('/put_here_the_path_to/swi-minisat')).
:- use_module([library(minisat)]).

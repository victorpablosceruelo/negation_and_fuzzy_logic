:- doc(module,"This library is intended to eaose the task of displaying
   some graphical results. This library allows the programmer to visualize
   different graphs and tables without knowing anything about specific
   graphical packages.

   You need to install the BLT package in your computer.  BLT is an
   extension to the Tk toolkit and it does not require any patching of
   the Tcl or Tk source files. You can find it in
   @href{http://www.tcltk.com/blt/index.html}

   Basically, when the user invokes a predicate, the library (internally)
   creates a bltwish interpreter and passes the information
   through a socket to display the required widget. The
   interpreter parses the received commands and executes them.

   The predicates exported by this library can be classified in four main
   groups, according to the types of representation they provide. 

   @begin{itemize} 

   @item bar charts

   @item line graphs
   
   @item scatter graphs

   @item tables
   @end{itemize}

   To represent graphs, the Cartesian coordinate system is used.
   I have tried to show simple samples for every library exported predicate in
   order to indicate how to call them.

   @section{Bar charts}

   In this section we shall introduce the general issues about the set of
   barchart predicates. By calling the predicates that pertain to this
   group a bar chart for plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates)
   can be created. A bar chart is a graphic means of comparing numbers by
   displaying bars of lengths proportional to the y-coordinates they
   represented. The barchart widget has many configurable options such as
   title, header text, legend and so on. You can configure the appearance
   of the bars as well.  The bar chart widget has the following components:

   @begin{description}

   @item{Header text} 

   The text displayed at the top of the window. If it is @tt{''} no text
   will be displayed.

   @item{Save button} The button placed below the header text. Pops up a
   dialog box for the user to select a file to save the graphic in
   PostScript format.@footnote{Limitation: Some printers can have problems
   if the PostScript file is too complex (i.e. too many points/lines appear
   in the picture).}

   @item{Bar chart title}
   The title of the graph. It is displayed at the top of the
   bar chart graph. If text is @tt{''} no title will be displayed.  

   @item{X axis title}
   X axis title. If text is @tt{''} no x axis title will be displayed.

   @item{Y axis title} Y axis title. If text is @tt{''} no y axis title
   will be displayed.

   @item{X axis} X coordinate axis.  The x axis is drawn at the bottom
   margin of the bar chart graph. The x axis consists of the axis line,
   ticks and tick labels. Tick labels can be numbers or plain text. If
   the labels are numbers, they could be displayed at uniform intervals
   (the numbers are treated as normal text) or depending on its x-coodinate
   value. You can also set limits (maximum and minimum) for the x axis, but
   only if the tick labels are numeric.

   @item{Y axis} Y coordinate axis. You can set limits (maximum and
   minimum) for the y axis. The y axis is drawn at the right margin of the
   bar chart graph.The y axis consists of the axis line, ticks and tick
   labels. The tick labels are numeric values determined from the data and
   are drawn at uniform intervals.

   @item{Bar chart graph}  This is the plotting area, placed
   in the center of the window and surrounded by the axes, the axis titles
   and the legend (if any). The range of the axes controls what region of
   the data is plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are
   determined from the data, but you can set them (as mentioned
   before). Data points outside the minimum and maximum value of the axes
   are not plotted.

   @item{Legend} The legend displays the name and symbol of each bar. The
   legend is placed in the right margin of the Bar chart graph.  

   @item{Footer text} Text displayed at the lower part of the window. If
   text is @tt{''} no header text will be displayed.

   @item{Quit button} Button placed below the footer text. Click it to
   close the window.

   @end{description}

   All of them are arranged in a window. However you can, for example, show
   a bar chart window without legend or header text. Other configuration
   options will be explained later.

   In addition to the window appearance there is another important issue
   about the bar chart window, namely its behaviour in response to user
   actions. The association user actions to response is called
   @em{bindings}. The main bindings currently specified are the following:
   
   @begin{description}

   @item{Default bindings} Those are well known by most users. They are
   related to the frame displayed around the window. As you know, you
   can interactively move, resize, close, iconify, deiconify, send to
   another desktop etc. a window.

   @item{Bindings related to bar chart graph and its legend} Clicking the
   left mouse key over a legend element, the corresponding bar turns out
   into red. After clicking again, the bar toggles to its original look. In
   addition, you can do zoom-in by pressing the left mouse key over the bar
   chart graph and dragging to select an area. To zoom out simply press
   the right mouse button. 

   When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs are
   drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines (one vertical
   and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is over a legend element,
   its background changes.

   @item{Bindings related to buttons} There are two buttons in the main
   widget. Clicking the mouse on the Save button a \"Save as\" dialog box is
   popped up. The user can select a file to save the graph. If the user
   choose a file that already exists, the dialog box prompts the user for
   confirmation on whether the existing file should be overwritten or
   not. Furthermore, you can close the widget by clicking on the Quit
   button.

   When the pointer passes over a button the button color changes.

   @end{description}

   The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names begin
   with @bf{barchart} and @bf{genmultibar}. If you take a look at the
   predicate names that pertain to this group, you will notice that they
   are not self-explanatory. It would have been better to name the
   predicates in a way that allows the user to identify the predicate
   features by its name, but it would bring about very long names (i.e
   barchart_WithoutLegend_BarsAtUniformIntervals_RandomBarsColors). For
   this reason I decided to simply add a number after barchart to name
   them.

   @section{Line graphs}

   It is frequently the case that several datasets need to be displayed on
   the same plot. If so, you may wish to distinguish the points in
   different datasets by joining them by lines of different color, or by
   plotting with symbols of different types. This set of predicates allows
   the programmer to represent two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). Each
   dataset contains x and y vectors containing the coordinates of the
   data. You can configure the appearance of the points and the lines which
   the points are connected with. The configurable line graph components
   are:

   @begin{description}

   @item{line graph} This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the
   window and surrounded by the axes, the axes titles and the legend (if
   any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is
   plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined from
   the data, but you can set them. Data points outside the minimum and
   maximum value of the axes are not plotted. You can specify how
   connecting line segments joining successive datapoints are drawn by
   setting the @var{Smooth} argument. Smooth can be either linear, step,
   natural and quadratic. Furthermore, you can select the appearance of the
   points and lines.

   @item{Legend} The legend displays the name and symbol of each line. The
   legend is placed in the right margin of the graph.  

   
   @end{description} 

   The elements header, footer, quit and save buttons, the titles and the
   axes are quite similar to those in barchart graphs, except in that the
   tick labels will be numbers. All of them are arranged in a window by the
   geometry manager. However you can, as we mentioned in the above
   paragraphs, show a line graph window without any titles or footer
   text. Other configuration options will be explained later in this
   section or in the corresponding modules.

   Related to the behaviour of the widgets in response to user actions
   (bindings) we will remark the following features: 

   @begin{description}

   @item{Bindings related to line graph and its legend} Clicking the
   left mouse key over a legend element, the corresponding line turns out
   into blue. Repeating the action reverts the line to its original
   color. Moreover, you can do zoom-in by clicking the left mouse key over
   the bar chart graph and dragging a rectangle defining the area you want
   to zoom in. To zoom out simply press the right mouse button.

   When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs are
   drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines (one vertical
   and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is over a legend element,
   its background changes.

   @item{Other bindings}The default bindings and the bindings related to
   the save and quit buttons are similar to those in the bar chart graphs.


   @end{description}

   The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names begin
   with @bf{graph_}.



   @section{Scatter graphs}

   The challenge of this section is to introduce some general aspects about
   the scatter graph predicates group. By invoking the scatter graph
   predicates the user can represent two-dimensional point datasets. Often
   you need to display one or several point datasets on the same plot. If
   so, you may wish to distinguish the points that pertain to different
   datasets by using plotting symbols of different types, or by displaying
   them in different colors. This set of predicates allows you to represent
   two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). Each dataset contains x and y
   vectors containing the coordinates of the data. You can configure the
   appearance of the points. The configurable scatter graph components
   are:

   @begin{description}

   @item{scatter graph} This is the plotting area, placed in the center of
   the window and surrounded by the axes, the axes titles and the legend
   (if any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is
   plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined from
   the data, but you can set them (as we mentioned before). Data points
   outside the minimum and maximum value of the axes are not plotted. The
   user can select the appearance of the points.

   @item{Legend} The legend displays the name and symbol of each point
   dataset. The legend is drawn in the right margin of the graph.


   @end{description}

   The elements header, footer, quit and save buttons, the titles and the
   axes are similar to those in barchart graphs except for that, as in line
   graphs, the tick labels will be numbers. All of them are arranged in a
   window by the geometry manager. However you can, for example, show a
   scatter graph window without titles or footer text, as we mentioned
   before. Other configuration options will be explained later, in the
   corresponding modules.

   Related to the behaviour of the widgets in response to user actions
   (bindings) the following features are: 

   @begin{description}

   
   @item{Bindings related to scatter graph and its legend} Clicking the
   left mouse key over a legend element, the points which belong to the
   corresponding dataset turn out into blue. Repeating the action toggles
   the point dataset to its original color. Moreover, you can do zoom-in by
   clicking the left mouse key over the bar chart graph and dragging a
   rectangle defining the area you want to zoom-in on. To do zoom-out
   simply press the right mouse button.

   When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs are
   drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines (one vertical
   and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is over a legend element,
   its background changes.

   @item{Other bindings} The default bindings and the bindings related to
   the save and quit buttons are similar to those in the bar chart graphs.

   @end{description}


   The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names began
   with @bf{scattergraph_}.

   @section{Tables}

   The purpose of this section is to allow the user to display results in a
   table. A table is a regular structure in which:

   @begin{itemize}

   @item Every row has the same number of columns, or

   @item Every column has the same number of rows.

   @end{itemize}

   The widget configurable components are as follows:

   @begin{description}

   @item{Title} 

   Title of the widget, it is displayed centered at the top of the
   canvas. If text is @tt{''} no title will be displayed.

   @item{Header text}

   Left centered text displayed bellow the title. If text is @tt{''} no
   header text will be displayed.

   @item{Table}

   Is placed in the center of the window. The table is composed by cells
   ordered in rows and columns. The cell values can be either any kind of
   text or numbers and they can be empty as well (see the type definition
   in the corresponding chapter module). A table is a list of lists. Each
   sublist is a row, so every sublist in the table must contain the same
   number of alements.

   @item{Footer text} 

   Left centered text displayed at the lower part of the window. If text is
   @tt{''} no header text will be displayed.

   @item{Quit button} 

   Button placed below the footer text. You can click
   it to close the window.

   @end{description}

   If the arguments are not in a correct format an exception will be
   thrown.  Moreover, these widgets have the default bindings and the
   binding related to the quit button:


   The set of predicates that belongs to this group are those which names
   begin with @bf{table_widget}.

  
  @section{Overview of widgets}

   
   Although you don't have to worry about how to arrange the widgets, here
   is an overview of how Tcl-tk, the underlying graphical system currently
   used by chartlib, performs this task. Quoting from the book @em{Tcl and
   Tk toolkit}, John K. Ousterhout.

   The X Window System provides many facilities for manipulating windows in
   displays. The root window may have any number of child windows, each of
   wich is called a top-level window. Top-level windows may have children
   of their own, wich may have also children, and so on. The descendants of
   top-level windows are called internal windows. Internal windows are
   usedfor individual controls such as buttons, text entries, and for
   grouping controls together. An X-application tipically manages several
   top-level windows. Tk uses X to implement a set of controls with the
   Motif look and feel. These controls are called widgets. Each widget is
   implemented using one X window, and the terms \"window\" and \"widget\"
   will be used interchangeably in this document. As with windows, widgets
   are nested in hierarchical structures. In this library top-level widgets
   (nonleaf or main) are just containers for organizing and arranging the
   leaf widgets (components). Thereby, the barchart widget is a top-level
   window wich contains some widget components.  

   Probably the most painstaking aspect of building a graphical application
   is getting the placement and size of the widgets just right.  It usually
   takes many iterations to align widgets and adjust their spacing.  That's
   because managing the geometry of widgets is simply not a packing
   problem, but also graphical design problem.  Attributes such as
   alignment, symmetry, and balance are more important than minimizing the
   amount of space used for packing.  Tk is similar to other X toolkits in
   that it does not allow widgets to determine their own geometries. A
   widget will not even appeared unless it is managed by a geometry
   manager. This separation of geometry management from internal widget
   behaviour allows multiple geometry managers to exist simultaneously and
   permits any widget to be used with any geometry manager. A geometry
   manager's job is to arrange one or more @em{slave} widgets relative to a
   @em{master} widgets. There are some geometry managers in Tk such as
   pack, place and canvas widget. We will use another one call table.@p

   The table geometry manager arranges widgets in a table.  It's easy to
   align widgets (horizontally and vertically) or to create empty space to
   balance the arrangement of the widgets.  Widgets (called slaves in the
   Tk parlance) are arranged inside a containing widget (called the
   master).  Widgets are positioned at row,column locations and may span
   any number of rows or columns.  More than one widget can occupy a single
   location.  The placement of widget windows determines both the size and
   arrangement of the table.  The table queries the requested size of each
   widget.  The requested size of a widget is the natural size of the
   widget (before the widget is shrunk or expanded).  The height of each
   row and the width of each column is the largest widget spanning that row
   or column.  The size of the table is in turn the sum of the row and
   column sizes.  This is the table's normal size.  The total number of
   rows and columns in a table is determined from the indices specified.
   The table grows dynamically as windows are added at larger indices.

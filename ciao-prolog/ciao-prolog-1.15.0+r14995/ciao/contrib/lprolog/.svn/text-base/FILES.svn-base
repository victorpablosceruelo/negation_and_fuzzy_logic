The files in this directory breakdown as follows.

These contain Amadeo's Prolog implementation of the higher order pattern described in (paper reference):
	hnorm.pl
	lambda_terms.pl
	pattern_unify.pl

These make up the lprolog packages:
	lprolog.pl
	lprolog_ops.pl
	lprolog_rt.pl
	lprolog_tr.pl
	lprolog_tr_aux.pl
	lprolog_tr_goal.pl
"lprolog.pl" defines the module and declares the translations predicates. It imports the other files.
"lprolog_tr.pl" contains the "higher level" framework code for the translation
"lprolog_tr_goal.pl" contains of the code for translation of goals for the new HO features
"lprolog_tr_aux.pl" has some additional translation code used by the above two
(specifically for creation of HO terms).
"lprolog_rt.pl" defines the runtime predicates used by the translated code.
"lprolog_ops.pl" just contains the operator declarations.

Example connection to an already running active module (daemon).

0.- AMS must be enabled in the server host. See ../README.

1.- The application is app.pl. It declares the application name and
    one "public" active module (look at the code).

2.- The active module is active.pl. 

3.- The active module "active" has to be compiled as a Ciao actmod
    with AMS publishing method, and started:

              ciaoc -a actmods/amsbased_publish active
              ./active &

4.- See 3. in ../README. In this case the http address is useless, you
    can put anything... 

5.- Compile "app" and run it (with one argument)!

    For example:    app 3

If you run several "apps" at the time, they will all use the same
"active" process.

Note: "active" will keep running after your tests --you may want to
       kill it. If you do this, the server would still think that it
       is running (and won't allow you to restart it) --to use it
       again you will have to kill and restart the server.

Note: Steps 3 and 4 have been swapped wrt the general case (see ../README).
      This is because if you precompile "active" before compiling it
      with -a the thing won't work (!).
      If you need to recompile "active" you can make it work by first
      removing active_opt.pl, compiling "active", THEN precompiling it
      (4) or rebuilding the _opt (which is a link) to recompile "app".

A very simple example program.

0.- AMS must be enabled in the server host by running "server" with
    the name of the server host.

    For example:    server clip.dia.fi.upm.es 2> server_log &

    Executable "strapper" must be in the same directory from where
    "server" is run.

1.- The application is app.pl. It declares the application name and
    one active module (look at the code).

2.- The active module is file.pl. It does nothing very relevant (look
    at the code) but gives some backtracking on the first argument.

3.- The active module "file" has to be precompiled by running "actmod"
    on it, giving the http address of it. 

    For example, if it would be located (as it currently is) in 
    http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/~clip then run:
                        actmod file "/~clip"

4.- Copy the original source code file.pl to the http address (and
    give it the required permissions). 

    In the example, copy it (though it should already be there) to:
    ~clip/public_html 

5.- Compile "app" and run it (with one argument)!

    For example:    app 3

Note: Each run of an active module would leave two "strapper"
      processes running: be careful to kill them!

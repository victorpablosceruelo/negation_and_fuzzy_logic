MINIPROLOG
==========

This program contains a minimal Warren Abstract Machine
implementation. It is based in the original work of Stefan Buettcher,
was migrated from java to C++ and extended by Edison Mera.

COMPILATION
===========

Just do `make all' and check the folder bin/_$(MPARCH) to
see the generated binaries.

In windows you can define:

MPARCH=win32vc  to compile using Visual C++
MPARCH=win32bcc to compile using Borland C++


ISSUES
======

To compile in windows you should use cygwin (Even if compiling for
VC++ or Borland C++).  However, in the case of VC++, to avoid the
Error C1902 you should start the proccess from the windows machine,
opening cygwin inside the Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt.

MINIMAL CONFIGURATION SCRIPTS FOR SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP
==================================================

This directory contains the minimal configuration scripts that are
necessary to bootstrap the system. The scripts detect basic
information, such as the C compiler and compilation options that are
required to compile the engine.

ADDING NEW MACHINES AND ARCHITECTURES

For addition of more machines and architectures, update
ciao/etc/ciao_get_arch, make a reasonable entry in
available-processors and update config-sysdep.sh.

NOTE ABOUT POSIX THREADS

I have been told that LINUX glibc v. 2 (aka libc v. 6) has
LinuxThreads (the POSIX Threads implementation used by CIAO) included
in it, and not as a external library.  Therefore, the mkf-LINUX should
not include "-lpthread" in the definition of the Makefile LIBS
variable.

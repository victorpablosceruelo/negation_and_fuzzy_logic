The files in this directory are intended to be replacements for the
ones in the 'config-sysdep' directory in order to test quickly
alternative compiler and/or system configurations.  The easiest way to
do that is probably to make symbolic links from the apropriate
configuration to the configuration file with the same architecture in
the directory above.

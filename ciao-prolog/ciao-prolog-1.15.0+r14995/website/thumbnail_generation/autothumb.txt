*  Public License.

Usage:
====================================================
Just call "autothumb". This is the normal usage.
It automatically generates everything missing in the
current directory and you'll get an index.html out.

autothumb [option | JPGs | gallery_directory]


Options:
====================================================
[cap]
Interactively displays the thumbnails and asks for
a caption text in the terminal window. The string is
stored in the gallery's config file ".autothumb".
You should have all thumbnails available when calling
this.
For displaying the images, the program 'xv' is used.

[cap auto]
Automatically sets the captions strings counting from
1 onwards. This can be used if you intend to manually
modify your config file anyway.

[clean]
Deletes all thumbnails and html pages in the current
gallery. Use with care if you have other html and jpg
stuff in your directories!

[init]
Just generates a new config file from scratch and exits.

[new]
Same as init.

[writenoconf]
Disables the writing of an gallery's .autothumb config
file. This is used if you would like to manage all your
galleries via one /etc/autothumb file. You can also set
the option WRITECONFIG=FALSE there.


Variables:
=====================================================
A bunch of variables is available to control the
gallery and html generation. All relevant ones are
written to the .autothumb config and can be changed
by the user. Particularly you may want to change
gallery TITLE, SUBTITLE, HTMLCOLS and EXTLINK1.

Here's a complete list of supported variables.

AUTOCAPTION
internal variable

BG_R
BG_G
BG_B
Sets the RGB value for the thumbnail background.
This must match the BG_HEX setting from the page!
Defaults are 102, 102, 119 (a blue gray).

BG_HEX
Sets the RGB value for the html page.
This must match the BG_x settings from the
thumbnail background!
Default is #666677 (a blue gray).

BRIGHTNESS
Modifies the brightness.
Range is -127 to 127. Default is 0.
Only to be used by other scripts in batch mode.

CAPTIONS
Default is FALSE.
If true, captions defined in the config file are generated.
Caption entries have the format "# filename.jpg caption text"
can also feature html tags. 
Captions can be interactively generated by calling autothumb
with parameter 'cap [auto]'.

CAPTIONSINSHOW
Show the captions also in the slideshow. Default is FALSE.

CAPTIONVIEWER
Defines the cmd line for interactive caption generation.
Default is 'xv -geometry +100+100 expand 2' which uses
the xv program to display the according thumb.

CAPTIONVIEWERKILL
Cmd line to close the caption viewer. Default is 'killall xv'
This is not really clean programming... ;)

CELLPADDING
Defines the distance around a thumbnail cell.
Default is 0 pixel. There should be no need to change this.

CELLSPACING
Defines the gap between two thumbnail cells in html.
Default is 10 pixel. May be changed according your actual
thumbail size and to esthetical reasons.

CONFIGFILE
To be set in any externally config file.
This is the only way to access the gallery's config
file if you have to renamed it.

Modifies the contrast.
Range is -127 to 127. Default is 0.
Only to be used by other scripts in batch mode.

If you want automated html slideshow, set it to the
number of seconds. Default is 9999 (off).
If you use DELAY, consider to also set LOOP=TRUE.

EXTLINK1
EXTLINK2
EXTLINK3
To be used to embed the gallery in your web system.
E.g. you can generally link to the parent dirs, using
EXTLINK3 and place it in /etc/autothumb.

FAVICON
Defines the favicon file for the gallery. Could be set systemwide
for all galleries in /etc/autothumb. Default is "/favicon.ico"

another pre-index (entry) page to your gallery.

KEEP_AR
Set it to true, if you want all thumbnails in same, fixed
rectangular size. Default is FALSE and aspect ratio is kept.

LIGHTNESS
Modifies the brightness of the colors.
Range is -100 to 100. Default is 0.

LOCK
To lock a directory and not accidently modify it, e.g.
after you have manually modified index.html.

This value is significant for the loading time if you
have hundreds of thumbnails on the page!

photos. You may want to add some more CONTRAST also.

SHOWFILENAME
I do not recommend using this in public galleries,
as it is unnecessary and not very esthetic.
Default is FALSE.

SHOWFILESIZE
May be necessary if you put raw image collections
on the web. Please consider using the mk-webpix script
that adapts image sizes for web usage.
Default is FALSE.

SUBTITLE
Sets the title of the index page. Html tags can be included,
you can even get two lines.

THUMBDIR
Defines the directory where all thumbs should go into.

kept (see KEEP_AR). DEfault is 120 pixel. See also HEIGHT.

WRITECONFIG
Disables the writing of an individually gallery's config
file. To be used in /etc/autothumb. Default is TRUE.


Notes:
==========================================================

- To change bg color you need to provide the RGB color
  in hex and decimal in .autothumb

- Autothumb currently does not handle filenames with spaces
  Use the 'mk-lower' script from the webpage to change all filenames

- Have a look at the demo galleries on the web site to
  maybe get a lot more ideas! http://fuchur.leute.server.de

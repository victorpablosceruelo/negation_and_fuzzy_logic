@bf{Ciao} is a @em{public domain}, @em{next generation} multi-paradigm
programming environment with a unique set of features:

@begin{itemize}
@item @bf{Ciao} offers a complete Prolog system, supporting
   @em{ISO-Prolog}, but its novel modular design allows both
   @em{restricting} and @em{extending} the language. As a result,
   it allows working with @em{fully declarative subsets} of Prolog
   and also to @em{extend} these subsets (or ISO-Prolog) both
   syntactically and semantically. Most importantly, these
   restrictions and extensions can be activated separately on each
   program module so that several extensions can coexist in the same
   application for different modules.

@item @bf{Ciao} also supports (through such extensions) programming with
   functions, higher-order (with predicate abstractions), constraints,
   and objects, as well as feature terms (records), persistence,
   several control rules (breadth-first search, iterative deepening,
   ...), concurrency (threads/engines), a good base for distributed
   execution (agents), and parallel execution. Libraries also support
   WWW programming, sockets, external interfaces (C, Java, TclTk,
   relational databases, etc.), etc.

@item @bf{Ciao} offers support for @em{programming in
   the large} with a robust module/object system, module-based
   separate/incremental compilation (automatically --no need for
   makefiles), an assertion language for declaring (@em{optional})
   program properties (including types and modes, but also
   determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc.), automatic static inference
   and static/dynamic checking of such assertions,
   etc. 

@item @bf{Ciao} also offers support for @em{programming in
   the small} producing small executables (including only those
   builtins used by the program) and support for writing scripts in
   Prolog. 

@item The @bf{Ciao} programming environment includes a
   classical top-level and a rich emacs interface with an embeddable
   source-level debugger and a number of execution visualization
   tools. 

@item The @bf{Ciao} compiler (which can be run outside
   the top level shell) generates several forms of
   architecture-independent and stand-alone executables, which run
   with speed, efficiency and executable size which are very
   competitive with other commercial and academic Prolog/CLP
   systems. Library modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C
   source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or
   autoloaded. 

@item The novel modular design of Ciao enables, in
   addition to modular program development, effective global program
   analysis and static debugging and optimization via source to source
   program transformation. These tasks are performed by the @bf{Ciao
   preprocessor} (@tt{ciaopp}, distributed separately). 

@item The @bf{Ciao} programming environment also
   includes @tt{lpdoc}, an automatic documentation generator for
   LP/CLP programs. It processes Prolog files adorned with
   (@bf{Ciao}) assertions and machine-readable comments and
   generates manuals in many formats including @tt{postscript},
   @tt{pdf}, @tt{texinfo}, @tt{info}, @tt{HTML},
   @tt{man}, etc. , as well as on-line help, ascii @tt{README}
   files, entries for indices of manuals (@tt{info}, WWW, ...),
   and maintains WWW distribution sites.

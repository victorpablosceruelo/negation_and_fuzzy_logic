Ciao is in very active and continuous development since the early 90's
by an international team, coordinated by CLIP group members at the
Technical University of Madrid, the IMDEA Software Institute, and the
University of New Mexico, USA.  It builds on its predecessor,
&-Prolog, developed between 1984 and the mid 90's at the University of
Texas at Austin, USA, the Microelectronics and Technology Corporation,
and the Technical University of Madrid.

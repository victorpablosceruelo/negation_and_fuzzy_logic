INSTRUCTIONS TO OPTIMIZE SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS
==============================================
(Work in Progress - Internal notes for Ciao developers)

In order to optimize the results of Web search engines of our domain
for Ciao (http://www.ciaohome.org), I registered to Google Webmaster
Tools (http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools) and followed the steps
indicated there.

Lets assume in the following text that WEBROOT is the directory in our
server where the web site is stored (i.e.,
/home/clip/public_html/Software/Ciao).

1) Prove to Google that we are the owners of http://www.ciaohome.org

   To do that, I upload a file that Google provided me
   (google45e109def1915150.html) in WEBROOT/
   
   =================================================
   = Ask me if you wish to be included as an owner =
   =================================================

2) Setup a robots.txt file and place it in WEBROOT/

   The contents are:

User-agent: *
Allow: /

3) Wait... :)


clip SERVER REDIRECTION
=======================

Traditionally Ciao software has been hosted in
http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Ciao. In order to use homonegeous
addresses (which I believe is better for users and search engines), we
redirect that address to http://www.ciaohome.org . I describe here how
it can be configured in Apache.

1) Add symbolic links to Software/ and Mail/:

   $ cd /home/clip/public_html/Software/Ciao
   $ ln -s ../../Software .
   $ ln -s ../../Main .

   Those are necessary for ancillary links that are not trivial to
   change, such as mailing lists and parameters passed to the CGI
   download application. Hopefully we could avoid this step in the
   future.

2) Include these lines in the httpd configuration
(/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default):

<Directory /home/clip/public_html/Software/Ciao>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>

   Remember to restart the server if necessary, e.g., by issuing the
   command '/etc/init.d/apache2 restart'.

3) Create a .htaccess in /home/clip/public_html/Software/Ciao
   with the following line:
 
redirectMatch 301 ^/Software/Ciao/(.*)$ http://www.ciaohome.org/$1

   At this moment, all accesses to the Ciao pages under
   clip.dia.fi.upm.es should be redirected to www.ciaohome.org.

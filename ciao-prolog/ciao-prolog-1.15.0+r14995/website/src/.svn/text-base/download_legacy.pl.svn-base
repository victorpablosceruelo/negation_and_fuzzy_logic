@section{Archived (Ciao >1.10)}

We provide here access to additional @href{packages/}{archived
versions} after Ciao 1.10, other than the latest and stable
versions. Ciao 1.10 and previous versions can be found below (the
distribution mechanism changed after 1.10).

@bf{Note on version numbering:} from Ciao 0.8 on, 'even' versions
(e.g., 1.0, 1.4, ...) denote stable distributions, whereas odd
versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.5, ...) denote development versions. The latter
are typically meant for users who would like to try out new
functionality and help us with testing of upcoming versions.

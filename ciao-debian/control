Description: The Ciao Prolog Development Environment
 Ciao is an Open Source, next generation, multi-paradigm
 programming environment with a unique set of features:
 .
  - Ciao offers a complete Prolog system, supporting _ISO-Prolog_,
    but its novel modular design allows both _restricting_ and
    _extending_ the language.
  - Ciao also supports programming with functions, higher-order
    constraints, objects, as well as feature terms (records),
    persistence, several control rules (breadth-first search,
    iterative deepening, ...), concurrency (threads/engines), a good
    base for distributed execution (agents), and parallel execution.
    Libraries also support WWW programming, sockets, external
    interfaces (C, Java, TclTk, relational databases, etc.), etc.
  - Ciao produces small executables (including only those builtins used
    by the program) and support for writing scripts in Prolog.
  - The Ciao programming environment includes a classical
    top-level and a rich emacs interface with an embeddable
    source-level debugger and a number of execution visualization
    tools.
